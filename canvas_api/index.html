<h2>Canvas API: calendar events, assignments, discussions</h2>

These pages share some code and some notes on using the Canvas API to
create and delete calendar events, assignments, and discussions.

<p>

  <b>Disclaimer:</b> The codes is <b>slow</b>
  and crude. It can probably be
  improved. The code is <b>quirky</b> and specific to my course
  design. Real programmers will probably run screaming.

<p>
  
  I will be happy to discuss and collaborate with anyone who
  thinks they can make this work better. I can offer limited or
  nonexistent support to anyone who wants to modify my quirky code for a
  different course set-up.

  <h3>Course set-up scheme</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Each class day is labelled by a title like "2.1" or "Review Chapter 2"
      or "Exam Chapter 2".
      <li>  Each class meeting either has a homework
  assignment or not. If a homework assignment is due for a class
  meeting, it is due before midnight on the day preceding the class
	meeting.
	<li> Each class meeting either has a Canvas discussion
	associated to it or
	not. Discussions are posted at 5pm two days before the class
	meeting.
  </ul>

  <h3>Usage</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Edit the text input file "sample_creation_input.txt". Get your
    Canvas course id number by logging in to Canvas. Navigate to the
    course you want to work on and look at the address bar in your
    browser to see the course code. That goes in the top line of the
      input file.
    <li>Each row after the top row has a date and title. These are
    required. Optional elements in each row are flags for homework
    assignments and discussions. See the file for how to format. Blank
    lines or lines that do not contain dates and titles are ignored, so
      you can put in comments or blank lines for your own convenience.
      <li>Run the creation script with "python3 gesso.py input_filename"
	at the command line.
	<li>See the file "sample_deletion_input.txt" and make the
	obvious edits. Run the deletion script with "python3
	palimpsest.py input_filename".
  </ul>
