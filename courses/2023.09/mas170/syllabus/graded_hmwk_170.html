<h3>Reading Problems</h3>

The purpose of Reading Problems (see the
section <a href="#ReadProbList">"Reading and Problem List"</a>) is to
help you understand the material in the reading. You are not expected to
solve all of the Reading Problems perfectly, but you are expected to
try.

<p>
  
Reading Problems will be graded for preparation and completeness, not
for correctness. In order to receive credit, all of your solutions,
correct or incorrect, must show evidence of your reasoning. Even a
true/false or fill-in-the-blank question requires at least a comment
that demonstrates your understanding. Complete sentences are not
required for reading problem solutions, but a final answer with no work shown
receives zero credit.

<p>
  
There are two ways for a Reading Problem solution to earn full
credit:
<ul>
  <li>Whether or not it is correct, your solution shows evidence of your
  thinking and understanding.
    <li>In place of a solution, you may receive credit 
by writing one or more complete sentences that explain
precisely where you are stuck. 
</ul>

<p>
  
Submit Reading Problems online on Canvas.  Your work may be typed or
written by hand. Your work must be submitted as a single pdf file,
whether it is handwritten or typed (pdf scanning is a built-in utility
for iphones and android phones).  Work is not accepted late. There are
no makeup assignments.
