<h3>Reading Problems</h3>

The purpose of Reading Problems (see the
section <a href="#ReadProbList">"Reading and Problem List"</a>) is to
help you understand the material in the reading. You are not expected to
solve all of the Reading Problems perfectly, but you are expected to
try.  Reading Problems will be graded for preparation and completeness,
not for correctness. There are two ways for a solution to earn full
credit:
<ul>
  <li>An attempted solution (correct or incorrect) shows evidence of
  your reasoning. Even a true/false or fill-in-the-blank question
  requires at least a comment that demonstrates your understanding: a final
  answer with no work shown receives zero credit. Complete sentences
    are not required.
    <li>If you are unable
to complete a particular solution, you may receive credit for that
problem by writing one or more complete sentences that articulate
precisely where you are stuck.
</ul>


<p>
  
Submit Reading Problems online on Canvas.  Your work may be typed or
written by hand. Your work must be submitted as a single pdf file,
whether it is handwritten or typed (pdf scanning is a built-in utility
for iphones and android phones).  Work is not accepted late. There are
no makeup assignments.
