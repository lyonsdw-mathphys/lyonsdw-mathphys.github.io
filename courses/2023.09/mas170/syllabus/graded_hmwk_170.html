<h3>Portfolio Check</h3>

We will periodically conduct classroom activities to help you assess the
completeness and effectiveness of your portfolio. The purpose of the
Portfolio Check is to help you understand how you imporve your homework
practices and strengthen your portfolio. Portfolio Check grading is for participation
and effort, not for right or wrong.
