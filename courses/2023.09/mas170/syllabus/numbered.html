<h3><a name="Course Goals, Objectives, and Learning Outcomes">11</a> Course Goals, Objectives, and Learning Outcomes</h3>

The primary goal of the course is <b>understanding and proficiency</b>
  in the use of mathematical concepts. Student learning objectives are
  proficiency in <b>reading</b>, <b>analysis and problem solving</b>,
  and <b>clear, concise communication</b>. Achievement of goals and
  objectives requires desire for learning, willingness to work hard,
  time commitment (two hours outside of class for every one hour in
  class), and persistence.

<p>
  
<b>Learning Outcomes Summary</b>. Understanding and using the mathematical
concepts of this course, a student who achieves the course learning objectives will:
<ul>
<li>demonstrate proficiency in reading skills
<li>demonstrate proficiency in analysis and problem solving skills
<li>demonstrate proficiency in clear, concise communication skills
</ul>


<h2><a name="Learning and Study"></a> Learning and Study</h2>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/learning.html"-->
<a name="Learning"></a>
<h3><a name="Learning">12</a> Learning</h3>

The process of reading, learning vocabulary, solving problems, and writing
is the only way to achieve real understanding and skills. No one else
can read, think, or write for you. It can be very helpful to watch other
people solve problems and explain ideas in class, in a video, in a study
group, or in a tutoring session, but there is no substitute for study
that you do yourself.

<p>

The time expectation for out-of-class work is two hours outside of class for
every one hour of class meeting time. Plan your study time in your weekly
schedule. 

<p>

The quality of your out-of-class study translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little study time guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality studying guarantees a positive learning
experience. Here is an outline of the work flow for each section in the text(s).

<p>

  <ul>
  <li><b>BEFORE class.</b> Read the text material indicated on the
	  course calendar. Make vocabulary study cards (or study lists)
	  for terminology, facts, and formulas from the new text
	  section. Work and submit to Canvas all of the "Reading
	  Problems" (see <a href="#ReadProbList">"Reading and Problem
	  List"</a> above). Note your questions, problems, and
	  difficulties. In the reading, where, precisely, do you have
	  trouble understanding? With the problems, what, precisely, is
	  obstructing you from completing a solution?
    <li><b>AFTER class.</b>  Review text material from
		previous class meetings. Revise your vocabulary and fact
		note cards; make sure your vocabulary list is complete.
		Solve and check solutions to all of the problems listed
		in the "Reading and Problem List" in the syllabus.
    <li><b>BEFORE each quiz.</b>  Assess your progress and
	proficiency. Have you addressed all the questions and
	difficulties noted previously?  Rehearse vocabulary using the
	cards or lists you have prepared.  Practice solving problems
	using a timer.  Follow up on any questions or gaps that remain.
    <li><b>AFTER each quiz.</b>  Assess (again!) your progress and
		      proficiency. Rework and check solutions to all
		      quiz problems for which you received less than
		      full credit.  Follow up (again!) on any questions
		      or gaps that remain.
  </ul>


<h3><a name="Study Strategies">13</a> Study Strategies</h3>

<ul>
<li>Plan for two hours of study outside of class for each hour of class.
<li>Keep an organized paper binder or electronic notebook with reading notes, homework solutions, and
  class notes (see the <a href="#Portfolio">Portfolio</a> section below). Mark your questions clearly with sticky notes or some
  other device and follow up every question, either in class
  or in office hours, until you gain understanding.
<li>After reading, summarize the material in your own words.
<li>Use flash cards or lists to learn
  vocabulary. Write each term on one side of a card. Write a definition
  (using complete sentences, not sentence fragments) and an example on
  the back of the card.
<li>To prepare for quizzes and exams, do the following, beginning some
  days to a week in advance.
<ul>
<li>Make an outline of course topics and problem types.
<li>Memorize vocabulary, including examples.
<li>Work and check solutions to problems from previous quizzes, exams,
  and homework.
</ul>
<li>If clock management during exams is an issue, practice working a few
  exam style problems once a week with a timer running.
<li>If test anxiety has a negative effect on your performance, here
  is <a href="http://www.studygs.net/tstprp8.htm">some advice</a>.
    <li>Do not become sleep deprived. Trading sleep for study time is
      counterproductive.
      <li>Eat a healthy diet and exercise every day. Eating poorly and
      lack of physical activity reduce your mental abilities.
</ul>


<a name="Portfolio"></a>
<h3><a name="Portfolio">14</a> Portfolio</h3>

Keep your work organized. Use electronic or hard copy media, whatever
works best for you. Whatever method you use, it should be designed to
facilitate sorting, searching, planning, and tracking. A complete
portfolio includes:
<ul>
  <li>Progress tracking sheet(s) (make a copy of the <a href="#ReadProbList">Reading and Problem
  List</a> that you can use for checking off the work you have completed)
  <li>Vocabulary notecards or study sheets (here
  are  <a href="../../syllabus_common/sample_notecards1.pdf">example notecards</a>)
  <li>Reading and class notes
  <li>Solved problems
</ul>
The portfolio is an essential tool for learning; it is also an essential
instrument for diagnosis and improvement. Bring your portfolio to class
meetings and to office hours.

<!--
<p>
There is no specific portfolio grade. However, a consistent, thorough,
and complete portfolio will influence the letter grade assignment for a
cumulative average near a grade cutoff borderline (see
the <a href="#LetterGrades">Letter Grades</a> section below). For
example, if two students both have an 86% cumulative average, the
student who has shown a consistently thorough portfolio during office
hours might receive a B+, while the other student might receive a B.

<h3><a name="Reading Problems">16</a> Reading Problems</h3>

The purpose of Reading Problems (see the
section <a href="#ReadProbList">"Reading and Problem List"</a>) is to
help you understand the material in the reading. You are not expected to
solve all of the Reading Problems perfectly, but you are expected to
try.

<p>
  
Reading Problems will be graded for preparation and completeness, not
for correctness. In order to receive credit, all of your solutions,
correct or incorrect, must show evidence of your reasoning. Even a
true/false or fill-in-the-blank question requires at least a comment
that demonstrates your understanding. Complete sentences are not
required for reading problem solutions, but a final answer with no work shown
receives zero credit.

<p>
  
There are two ways for a Reading Problem solution to earn full
credit:
<ul>
  <li>Whether or not it is correct, your solution shows evidence of your
  thinking and understanding.
    <li>In place of a solution, you may receive credit 
by writing one or more complete sentences that explain
precisely where you are stuck. 
</ul>

<p>
  
Submit Reading Problems online on Canvas.  Your work may be typed or
written by hand. Your work must be submitted as a single pdf file,
whether it is handwritten or typed (pdf scanning is a built-in utility
for iphones and android phones).  Work is not accepted late. There are
no makeup assignments.

</ul>

<p>

  <h4>Quizzes: Grading</h4>

For full credit, quiz solutions must show not just final results, but
also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work and using appropriate
vocabulary that you understand the reasoning involved. Some solutions
(marked by the label "<b>DISCUSSION</b>") must be written in narrative
form, using one or more complete sentences.  Solutions will be graded
not only for mathematical correctness, but for clarity of writing.
Illegible work or a final answer given without supporting work shown
receives no credit.

   ------------     ------
        A           excellent
        B           good
        C           satisfactory
        D           requirements and standards met at a minimum level
        F           course requirements not met
</pre>

Standards for "excellent" and "good" (letter grades A and B) are high.
In this course, your grade reflects your proficiency with the material.  A good
grade is not guaranteed by class attendance and performing the motions of
homework; to earn an A or a B, you must demonstrate understanding that
transcends mere rote familiarity.

<h4>Determination of letter grade</h4>

At the end of the semester, your final cumulative average is used to
assign a letter grade.  The scale used to convert cumulative averages to
letter grades is based on the "standard 10 point scale" (A-,A,A+ for
90 to 100 percent range, B-,B,B+ for percentages in the 80's, C-,C,C+
for the 70's, etc.), but the scale may be adjusted, at the discretion of
the instructor, so that the meanings of the letter grades fit the
descriptions given in the previous section. Pluses and minuses are used
to distinguish between the low, middle and high achievers within each
letter grade category.

<p>
<i>Note on mid-term grades:</i> Pluses and minuses are not used for
midterm grades.

<h3><a name="Attendance">21</a> Attendance</h3>

Class attendance is expected, but it is understood that sometimes there
are reasonable circumstances for absence. Absence from class may be
excused, at the discretion of the instructor, for certain events planned
in advance or for emergency or illness. Here is the procedure to follow
if you wish to have an absence excused.
<ul>
<li>Send the instructor email notice of your absence as far as
  possible in advance, with a complete
  explanation for the purpose of your conflicting event.
    <li>In the case of illness or emergency where advance
      notice is not possible, send an email message as soon as it is
      practically possible. Except for extreme circumstances, your email
      notice is due by 5pm on the day of the absence. Collect
      documentation (doctor's notes, etc)
      and send them to the instructor by email.
</ul>

<p>

You will receive a grade of "Excused" for any assignment that you miss
on a day when you have an excused absence. An "Excused" grade does not
count for you or against you in your cumulative average. You will
receive a grade of zero for any assignment that you miss on a day when
you have an absence that is not excused. 

<p>
  
There is no specific grade for attendance, and participation (see the
exception for "chronic absenteeism" below). However, attendance,
participation, and engagement will influence the letter grade assignment for a
cumulative average near a grade cutoff borderline (see
the <a href="#LetterGrades">Letter Grades</a> section). For example, if
two students both have an 86% cumulative average, the student who has
shown consistent class attendance, participation, and engagement might receive a B+,
while a student who has several unexcused absences or low participation
might receive a B.

<p>

  <b>Policy for chronic absenteeism:</b> Chronic unexcused absence has a
  negative impact on classroom learning. The instructor may elect to
  impose a grade deduction for each unexcused absence beyond the
  third. Communication will be made by email when this policy is in
  effect.

<h3><a name="Class Engagement">22</a> Class Engagement</h3>
  
The purpose of class meetings is to pursue understanding and proficiency
with the course material. This requires mental presence, engagement with
the subject, and participation. Class meetings presume respect,
politeness, and kindness among all those in attendance. In consideration
for the learning environment, please observe the following.

<ul>
<!--  <li>Online attendees must have video on.-->
<li>No food is allowed during class.
<li>Use electronic devices only for engaging with the course
  material. For example, note-taking, calculating, and looking up facts
  related to the class discussion are positive activities; text
  messaging, social media browsing, and web surfing are rude behaviors
  that distract everyone from focusing.
  <li>Except for emergencies, please do not leave the class meeting once class
  begins. If you need to leave before the end of class, please inform
  the instructor before class begins.
</ul>

<h3><a name="Quantitative Reasoning (QR)">26</a> Quantitative Reasoning (QR)</h3>

<i>[Quantitative Reasoning (QR) is a component of the Constellation LVC
  Core Curriculum. QR learning outcomes are addressed in course
  assignments and class activities. The following material is quoted
  from the LVC website and documents from Academic Affairs.]</i>

<p>
  
<b>QR Description:</b>
Reason about and solve quantitative problems from a wide array of
contexts. Read, understand, and create arguments supported by
quantitative evidence and clearly communicate those arguments using a
variety of formats. Learn to make judgments and draw appropriate
conclusions based on the quantitative analysis of data.

<p>
  
<b>QR Criteria & Learning Outcomes</b>
                                                        
<ul>
<li>  Students will understand information presented in mathematical forms
(e.g., equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words), including the
ability to learn about and interpret unfamiliar quantitative structures.
                                                
<li>Students will convert relevant information into various mathematical
forms (e.g., equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words).

<li>Students will make judgments and draw appropriate conclusions based on
the quantitative analysis of data, while recognizing the assumptions
used and other limits of the analysis.

<li>Students will clearly express the results of the interpretation,
representation, application, and analysis of quantitative information in
an effective format.

<li>Courses must have a significant and continuing focus on working with
quantitative arguments.
