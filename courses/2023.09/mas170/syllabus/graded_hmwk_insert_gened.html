Reading Problems will be graded for preparation and completeness, not
for correctness. In order to receive credit, all of your solutions,
correct or incorrect, must show evidence of your reasoning. Even a
true/false or fill-in-the-blank question requires at least a comment
that demonstrates your understanding. Complete sentences are not
required for reading problem solutions, but a final answer with no work shown
receives zero credit. If you cannot complete a solution, you may receive credit 
by writing one or more complete sentences that explain
precisely where you are stuck.
