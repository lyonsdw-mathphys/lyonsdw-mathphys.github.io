<h3>Writing Assignments</h3>  

Writing assignments must be typed and must use appropriate mathematical
symbols and typesetting conventions. Handwritten solutions will not be
accepted. Your writing assignment will be graded for correctness in the following ways:
for correct use of vocabulary and notation; for correct logical flow in your
argument; and for the correct final conclusion(s). The grading rubric
for each written solution is the same as for
the <a href="#quiz_grading_rubric">"Quiz Grading Rubric"</a> (MAS 113)
or the <a href="#exam_grading_rubric">"Exam Grading Rubric"</a>
(MAS 311), with the addition of the following in the description of the top
category called "complete and correct".

<blockquote>
  The written solution is typed and uses appropriate mathematical
    symbols and typesetting conventions.
