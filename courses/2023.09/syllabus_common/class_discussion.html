<h3>Class Discussion</h3>
  
Most of each class meeting will be discussion about the reading material
and problem solving. To give everyone the same fair chance for
discussion requests, we will use a Canvas Discussion board to organize
our agenda. To maximize learning quality, post your discussion request
with your partial progress. <i>[The first step to get past
  being stuck or confused is to try something. Show us what you tried!]</i>

<ul>
  <li>Phrase your question using one or more complete sentences. Attach
    a photo or scan of your partial work.
    (These are important steps in the learning process.)
    <li>You may update or withdraw a discussion request by replying to
    your own post. 
    <li>In order to give everyone a fair chance to post discussion
    requests, each Discussion board opens at 5pm two days before the
    class meeting when the discussion will take place.
      <li>Again for the sake of fairness and giving everyone an equal
      chance, there will be no "place holding". This means that you
      can't reserve a slot for a question by posting a question and then
	replacing it with another question when your turn comes up.
</ul>
