<h3>Makeup Assignments and Extra Credit</h3>

<!-- UPDATE NEEDED each semester: -->
<!-- choose and insert a cutoff date for the last few quizzes -->

<p>
A makeup quiz will be given during the final exam period for anyone who
has missed three or more quizzes before 4/7, or who has missed 1 or more
quizzes after 4/7 (this applies to all missed quizzes, whether or not
the missed quiz grade is excused; see the
section <a href="#Attendance">"Attendance"</a> regarding excused
absences). The makeup quiz will be up to twice as long as quizzes given
before final exam week.

<p>
  
A makeup comprehensive final exam will be given during the final exam
period for anyone who has missed five or more quizzes before
final exam week. The makeup comprehensive final exam covers all of the semester
material. The makeup comprehensive final exam will count the same as
the total of the missed quizzes.

<p>

Format and instructions for a makeup quiz or makeup comprehensive final
exam will be announced in advance.

There are no makeup pre-class assignments. There are no extra credit assignments.
