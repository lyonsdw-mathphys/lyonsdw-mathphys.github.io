<h3>Learning</h3>

The process of reading, learning vocabulary, solving problems, and writing
is the only way to achieve real understanding and skills.

<p>

The time expectation for out-of-class work is two hours outside of class for
every one hour of class meeting time. Plan your study time in your weekly
schedule.
