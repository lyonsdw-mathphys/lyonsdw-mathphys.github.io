<h3>Course Goals, Objectives, and Learning Outcomes</h3>

The primary goal of the course is <b>understanding and proficiency</b>
  in the use of mathematical concepts. Student learning objectives are
  proficiency in <b>reading</b>, <b>analysis and problem solving</b>,
  and <b>clear, concise communication</b>. Achievement of goals and
  objectives requires desire for learning, willingness to work hard,
  time commitment (two hours outside of class for every one hour in
  class), and persistence.

<p>
  
<b>Learning Outcomes Summary</b>. Understanding and using the mathematical
concepts of this course, a student who achieves the course learning objectives will:
<ul>
<li>demonstrate proficiency in reading skills
<li>demonstrate proficiency in analysis and problem solving skills
<li>demonstrate proficiency in clear, concise communication skills
</ul>


<h2>Learning and Study</h2>

<!--@include "learning_3XX.html"-->
<a name="Learning"></a>
<h3>Learning</h3>

The process of reading, learning vocabulary, solving problems, and writing
is the only way to achieve real understanding and skills.

<p>

The time expectation for out-of-class work is two hours outside of class for
every one hour of class meeting time. Plan your study time in your weekly
schedule. 

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/portfolio.html"-->
<a name="Portfolio"></a>
<h3>Portfolio</h3>

Keep your work organized. Use electronic or hard copy media, whatever
works best for you. Whatever method you use, it should be designed to
facilitate sorting, searching, planning, and tracking. A complete
portfolio includes:
<ul>
  <li>Progress tracking sheet(s) (make a copy of the <a href="#ReadProbList">Reading and Problem
  List</a> that you can use for checking off the work you have completed)
  <li>Vocabulary notecards or study sheets (here
  are  <a href="../../syllabus_common/sample_notecards1.pdf">example notecards</a>)
  <li>Reading and class notes
  <li>Solved problems
</ul>
Your portfolio is an essential tool for learning; it is also an essential
instrument for diagnosis and improvement. Bring your portfolio to class
meetings and to office hours.


<h2>Grades and Other Policies</h2>

<!--@include "grade_categories.html"-->
  <h3>Graded Work</h3>
  
Your cumulative average is determined by graded work in the categories listed
below with the indicated weights. Details and instructions are given in

<h3>Reading Problems</h3>

The purpose of Reading Problems (see the
section <a href="#ReadProbList">"Reading and Problem List"</a>) is to
help you understand the material in the reading. You are not expected to
solve all of the Reading Problems perfectly, but you are expected to
try.

<!--@include "graded_hmwk_insert_3XX.html"-->
<p>
  
Reading Problems will be graded for preparation and completeness, not
for correctness. For full credit, all solutions must be written in
narrative form, using one or more complete sentences.

<p>
  
<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/graded_hmwk_bottom.html"-->
<p>
  
Submit Reading Problems online on Canvas.  Your work may be typed or
written by hand. Your work must be submitted as a single pdf file,
whether it is handwritten or typed (pdf scanning is a built-in utility
for iphones and android phones).  Work is not accepted late. There are
no makeup assignments.
