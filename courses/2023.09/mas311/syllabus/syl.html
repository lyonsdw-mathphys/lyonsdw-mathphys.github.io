<h3><a name="Course Goals, Objectives, and Learning Outcomes">11</a> Course Goals, Objectives, and Learning Outcomes</h3>

The primary goal of the course is <b>understanding and proficiency</b>
  in the use of mathematical concepts. Student learning objectives are
  proficiency in <b>reading</b>, <b>analysis and problem solving</b>,
  and <b>clear, concise communication</b>. Achievement of goals and
  objectives requires desire for learning, willingness to work hard,
  time commitment (two hours outside of class for every one hour in
  class), and persistence.

<p>
  
<b>Learning Outcomes Summary</b>. Understanding and using the mathematical
concepts of this course, a student who achieves the course learning objectives will:
<ul>
<li>demonstrate proficiency in reading skills
<li>demonstrate proficiency in analysis and problem solving skills
<li>demonstrate proficiency in clear, concise communication skills
</ul>


<h2><a name="Learning and Study"></a> Learning and Study</h2>

<!--@include "learning_3XX.html"-->
<a name="Learning"></a>
<h3><a name="Learning">12</a> Learning</h3>

The process of reading, learning vocabulary, solving problems, and writing
is the only way to achieve real understanding and skills. No one else
can read, think, or write for you. It can be very helpful to watch other
people solve problems and explain ideas in class, in a video, in a study
group, or in a tutoring session, but there is no substitute for study
that you do yourself.

<p>

The time expectation for out-of-class work is two hours outside of class for
every one hour of class meeting time. Plan your study time in your weekly
schedule. 

<a name="Portfolio"></a>
<h3><a name="Portfolio">13</a> Portfolio</h3>

Keep your work organized. Use electronic or hard copy media, whatever
works best for you. Whatever method you use, it should be designed to
facilitate sorting, searching, planning, and tracking. A complete
portfolio includes:
<ul>
  <li>Progress tracking sheet(s) (make a copy of the <a href="#ReadProbList">Reading and Problem
  List</a> that you can use for checking off the work you have completed)
  <li>Vocabulary notecards or study sheets (here
  are  <a href="../../syllabus_common/sample_notecards1.pdf">example notecards</a>)
  <li>Reading and class notes
  <li>Solved problems
</ul>
The portfolio is an essential tool for learning; it is also an essential
instrument for diagnosis and improvement. Bring your portfolio to class
meetings and to office hours.

<!--
<p>
There is no specific portfolio grade. However, a consistent, thorough,
and complete portfolio will influence the letter grade assignment for a
cumulative average near a grade cutoff borderline (see
the <a href="#LetterGrades">Letter Grades</a> section below). For
example, if two students both have an 86% cumulative average, the
student who has shown a consistently thorough portfolio during office
hours might receive a B+, while the other student might receive a B.

<h3><a name="Reading Problems">15</a> Reading Problems</h3>

The purpose of Reading Problems (see the
section <a href="#ReadProbList">"Reading and Problem List"</a>) is to
help you understand the material in the reading. You are not expected to
solve all of the Reading Problems perfectly, but you are expected to
try.

<p>
  
Reading Problems will be graded for preparation and completeness, not
for correctness. For full credit, all solutions must be written in
narrative form, using one or more complete sentences.

<p>
  
Submit Reading Problems online on Canvas.  Your work may be typed or
written by hand. Your work must be submitted as a single pdf file,
whether it is handwritten or typed (pdf scanning is a built-in utility
for iphones and android phones).  Work is not accepted late. There are
no makeup assignments.

<h3><a name="Exams">16</a> Exams</h3>

Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. In keeping with College
policy, the final exam can only be taken at the officially scheduled
time during final exams week.

<p>
  
For full credit, exam solutions must show not just final results, but
also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work and using appropriate
vocabulary that you understand the reasoning involved. Solutions must be
written in narrative form, using one or more complete sentences.
Solutions will be graded not only for mathematical correctness, but for
clarity of writing.  Illegible work or a final answer given without
supporting work shown receives no credit.

<p>

No music listening devices or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during quizzes or exams. If you need to leave the
classroom during an exam, you must leave your cell phone at the
instructor's desk in the front of the room.

<p>

Here is the rubric for each exam problem solution. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.

  web pages </a> of the LVC Registrar. 

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/letter_grades.html"-->
<a name="LetterGrades"></a>
<h3><a name="Letter Grades">19</a> Letter Grades</h3>

<h4>Meaning of letter grades</h4>

According to the College Catalog, letter grades have the following
meanings.

<pre>
   Letter Grade     Meaning
   ------------     ------
        A           excellent
        B           good
        C           satisfactory
        D           requirements and standards met at a minimum level
        F           course requirements not met
</pre>

Standards for "excellent" and "good" (letter grades A and B) are high.
In this course, your grade reflects your proficiency with the material.  A good
grade is not guaranteed by class attendance and performing the motions of
homework; to earn an A or a B, you must demonstrate understanding that
transcends mere rote familiarity.

<h4>Determination of letter grade</h4>

At the end of the semester, your final cumulative average is used to
assign a letter grade.  The scale used to convert cumulative averages to
letter grades is based on the "standard 10 point scale" (A-,A,A+ for
90 to 100 percent range, B-,B,B+ for percentages in the 80's, C-,C,C+
for the 70's, etc.), but the scale may be adjusted, at the discretion of
the instructor, so that the meanings of the letter grades fit the
descriptions given in the previous section. Pluses and minuses are used
to distinguish between the low, middle and high achievers within each
letter grade category.

<p>
<i>Note on mid-term grades:</i> Pluses and minuses are not used for
midterm grades.


<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/attendance.html"-->
<h3><a name="Attendance">20</a> Attendance</h3>

Class attendance is expected, but it is understood that sometimes there
are reasonable circumstances for absence. Absence from class may be
excused, at the discretion of the instructor, for certain events planned
in advance or for emergency or illness. Here is the procedure to follow
if you wish to have an absence excused.
<ul>
<li>Send the instructor email notice of your absence as far as
  possible in advance, with a complete
  explanation for the purpose of your conflicting event.
    <li>In the case of illness or emergency where advance
      notice is not possible, send an email message as soon as it is
      practically possible. Except for extreme circumstances, your email
      notice is due by 5pm on the day of the absence. Collect
      documentation (doctor's notes, etc)
      and send them to the instructor by email.
</ul>

<p>

You will receive a grade of "Excused" for any assignment that you miss
on a day when you have an excused absence. An "Excused" grade does not
count for you or against you in your cumulative average. You will
receive a grade of zero for any assignment that you miss on a day when
you have an absence that is not excused. 

<p>
  
There is no specific grade for attendance, and participation (see the
exception for "chronic absenteeism" below). However, attendance,
participation, and engagement will influence the letter grade assignment for a
cumulative average near a grade cutoff borderline (see
the <a href="#LetterGrades">Letter Grades</a> section). For example, if
two students both have an 86% cumulative average, the student who has
shown consistent class attendance, participation, and engagement might receive a B+,
while a student who has several unexcused absences or low participation
might receive a B.

<p>

  <b>Policy for chronic absenteeism:</b> Chronic unexcused absence has a
  negative impact on classroom learning. The instructor may elect to
  impose a grade deduction for each unexcused absence beyond the
  third. Communication will be made by email when this policy is in
  effect.

<!-- DISCUSSION BOARD SECTION TURNED OFF 8/2021 -->
<!--@DONOTinclude "../../syllabus_common/class_discussion.html"-->
<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/class_engagement.html"-->
<h3><a name="Class Engagement">21</a> Class Engagement</h3>
  
The purpose of class meetings is to pursue understanding and proficiency
with the course material. This requires mental presence, engagement with
the subject, and participation. Class meetings presume respect,
politeness, and kindness among all those in attendance. In consideration
for the learning environment, please observe the following.

<ul>
<!--  <li>Online attendees must have video on.-->
<li>No food is allowed during class.
<li>Use electronic devices only for engaging with the course
  material. For example, note-taking, calculating, and looking up facts
  related to the class discussion are positive activities; text
  messaging, social media browsing, and web surfing are rude behaviors
  that distract everyone from focusing.
  <li>Except for emergencies, please do not leave the class meeting once class
  begins. If you need to leave before the end of class, please inform

<h3><a name="Collaboration versus Plagiarism">22</a> Collaboration versus Plagiarism</h3>

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and ask questions of
the instructor or consult any source for homework. You must work hard to
avoid plagiarism, which is presenting someone else's ideas or work as
your own.  <b>The work you submit must be your own.</b> Your writing
must be your own voice and your own understanding.  You must use proper
academic citation for any material created by others.  Plagiarism is a
serious academic offense; penalties range from failing the course to
expulsion from the college.

<ul>
<li>  Students will understand information presented in mathematical forms
(e.g., equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words), including the
ability to learn about and interpret unfamiliar quantitative structures.
                                                
<li>Students will convert relevant information into various mathematical
forms (e.g., equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words).

<li>Students will make judgments and draw appropriate conclusions based on
the quantitative analysis of data, while recognizing the assumptions
used and other limits of the analysis.

<li>Students will clearly express the results of the interpretation,
representation, application, and analysis of quantitative information in
an effective format.

<li>Courses must have a significant and continuing focus on working with
quantitative arguments.
