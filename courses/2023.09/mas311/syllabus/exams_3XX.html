<h3>Exams</h3>  

Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. In keeping with College
policy, the final exam can only be taken at the officially scheduled
time during final exams week.

For full credit, exam solutions must show not just final results, but
also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work and using appropriate
vocabulary that you understand the reasoning involved. Solutions must be
written in narrative form, using one or more complete sentences.
Solutions will be graded not only for mathematical correctness, but for
clarity of writing.  Illegible work or a final answer given without
supporting work shown receives no credit.

No music listening devices or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during quizzes or exams. If you need to leave the
classroom during an exam, you must leave your cell phone at the
instructor's desk in the front of the room.

Here is the grading rubric for solutions to exam problems.
