<h3>Quizzes</h3>  

We will have a quiz with two or three problems at the beginning of class
one day each week.  Quiz problems are based on, but not limited to, the
assigned reading and exercises. 

<p>

The final quiz will take during the last class meeting (on the last day
of classes).  The final quiz will have problems from the whole semester,
and will be about twice the length of other quizzes.

<p>
  
Quiz format and subject matter will be announced in advance; a summary
page with quiz dates and subject matter will be maintained on the Canvas
course homepage.

  <h4>Quizzes: grading</h4>

For full credit, quiz solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work and using
appropriate vocabulary that you understand the reasoning involved. Some
solutions must be written in narrative form, using one or more complete
sentences.  Solutions will be graded not only for mathematical
correctness, but for clarity of writing.  Illegible work or a final
answer given without supporting work shown receives no credit.

Here is the rubric for each quiz problem solution. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.
