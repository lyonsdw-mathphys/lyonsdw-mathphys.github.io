<h3>Pre-Class Assignments</h3>

Homework is reading course material, learning definitions of terms and
statements of facts and formulas, solving problems, checking your
solutions, and following up on questions (see
the <a href="#Learning">Learning</a> section). Only a small bit of
homework, called a "pre-class assignment", is graded. Before midnight
on <i>the day before</i> each class meeting, except for days marked
"Workshop" on the Course Calendar, you will show evidence of engagement
with the text by submitting at least two vocabulary study items
(terminology, facts, or formulas) for the text section(s) listed on the
Course Calendar for the <i>next</i> day's class meeting. For each
vocabulary item, give a definition of the term or a statement of the
fact or formula using one or more complete sentences, and give an
example that illustrates the term or fact. Good examples require careful
reading and thought. Sometimes, even the simplest examples may take up
more space that will easily fit on 3 by 5 inch notecard. In this case,
just add another card. In the unusual circumstance that a text section
has only one or perhaps even no new vocabulary items, just add another
one or two items from other text sections (but do submit *new* cards
that you have not previously submitted!) so that your total submission
has at least two vocabulary items.

  <h4>Pre-Class Assignment Submission Instructions</h4>

Submit pre-class assignments online on Canvas. All vocabulary items must be
written using one or more complete sentences. Your work may be typed or
written by hand. Your work must be submitted as a single pdf file,
  whether it is handwritten or typed (pdf scanning is a built-in utility
  for iphones and android phones).  Work is not accepted late. There are no makeup
assignments.

<h4>Pre-Class Standards and Grading</h4>

  Pre-class assignments will be graded for preparation and completeness,
    not for correctness. Here is the rubric for graded pre-class
assignments.
