<h3>Attendance</h3>

Class attendance is expected, but it is understood that sometimes there
are reasonable circumstances for absence. For most students, there is no
grade for attendance or participation (see the exception for "chronic
absenteeism" below), but it is expected that each student will exercise
good judgment for choosing to miss a class.

<p>

Absence from class may be excused, at the discretion of the instructor, for
certain events planned in advance or for emergency or illness. Here is
the procedure to follow if you wish to have an absence excused.
<ul>
<li>Send the instructor email notice of your absence as far as
  possible in advance, with a complete
  explanation for the purpose of your conflicting event.
    <li>In the case of illness or emergency where advance
      notice is not possible, send an email message as soon as it is
      practically possible. Except for extreme circumstances, your email
      notice is due by 5pm on the day of the absence. Collect
      documentation (doctor's notes, etc)
      and send them to the instructor by email.
</ul>

<p>

You will receive a grade of "Excused" for a quiz that you miss on a day
when you have an excused absence. An "Excused" grade does not count for
you or against you in your cumulative average. You will receive a grade
of zero for a quiz that you miss on a day when you have an unexcused
absence. Absence does not change the due date for pre-class assignments.

<p>

  <b>Policy for chronic absenteeism:</b> Chronic unexcused absence has a
  negative impact on classroom learning. The instructor may elect to
  impose a grade deduction for each unexcused absence beyond the
  third. Communication will be made by email when this policy is in
  effect.
