<h3>Exams</h3>  

Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. In keeping with College
policy, the final exam can only be taken at the officially scheduled
time during final exams week.

For full credit, quiz and exam solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work and using
appropriate vocabulary that you understand the reasoning involved. Some
solutions must be written in narrative form, using one or more complete
sentences.  Solutions will be graded not only for mathematical
correctness, but for clarity of writing.  Illegible work or a final
answer given without supporting work shown receives no credit.

<p>

No music listening devices or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during quizzes or exams. If you need to leave the
classroom during an exam, you must leave your cell phone at the
instructor's desk in the front of the room.

<p>

<b>Exam replacement policy:</b> In the event that it becomes infeasible
to carry out one or more of the face-to-face exams, including the final
exam (for example, due to a pandemic or extreme weather or some other
reason), the instructor may replace one or more of those exams by
take-home assignments, possibly with different weights than the exams
that are being replaced.

Here is the rubric for each exam problem solution. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.
