A makeup quiz will be given during the final exam period for anyone who
has been excused from three or more quizzes before 4/7, or who has been
excused from 1 or more quizzes after 4/7 (see the
section <a href="#Attendance">"Attendance"</a> regarding excused
absences). The makeup quiz will be up to twice as long as quizzes given
before final exam week.

A makeup comprehensive final exam will be given during the final exam
period for anyone who has been excused from five or more quizzes before
