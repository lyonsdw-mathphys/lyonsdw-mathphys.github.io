<h3><a name="Pre-Class Assignments">13</a> Pre-Class Assignments</h3>

Homework is reading course material, learning definitions of terms and
statements of facts and formulas, solving problems, checking your
solutions, and following up on questions (see
the <a href="#Learning">Learning</a> section above). Only a small bit of
homework, called a "pre-class assignment", is graded. Before midnight
on <i>the day before</i> each class meeting, except for days marked
"Workshop" on the Course Calendar, you will show evidence of engagement
with the text by submitting at least two vocabulary study items
(terminology, facts, or formulas) for the text section(s) listed on the
Course Calendar for the <i>next</i> day's class meeting. For each
vocabulary item, give a definition of the term or a statement of the
fact or formula using one or more complete sentences, and give an
example that illustrates the term or fact. You may use any format that
works best for you: physical notecards or sheets of paper, or
electronic versions of these.

<p>

Good examples require careful
reading and thought. Sometimes, even the simplest examples may take up
more space that will easily fit on 3 by 5 inch notecard. In this case,
just add another card. In the unusual circumstance that a text section
has only one or perhaps even no new vocabulary items, just add another
one or two items from other text sections (but do submit *new* cards
that you have not previously submitted!) so that your total submission
has at least two vocabulary items.

<p>
  
<a href="../../syllabus_common/sample_notecards1.pdf">Here</a> are
some sample vocabulary notecards.



<p>
  
  <h4>Pre-Class Assignment Submission Instructions</h4>

Submit pre-class assignments online on Canvas. All vocabulary items must be
written using one or more complete sentences. Your work may be typed or
written by hand. Your work must be submitted as a single pdf file,
  whether it is handwritten or typed (pdf scanning is a built-in utility
  for iphones and android phones).  Work is not accepted late. There are no makeup
assignments.

<h4>Pre-Class Assignments Standards and Grading</h4>

  Pre-class assignments will be graded for preparation and completeness,
    not for correctness. Here is the rubric for graded pre-class
assignments.

    exam. This work is my own</i>."</ul>
</ul>

<p>

  <h4>Quizzes: grading</h4>

For full credit, quiz solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work and using
appropriate vocabulary that you understand the reasoning involved. Some
solutions must be written in narrative form, using one or more complete
sentences.  Solutions will be graded not only for mathematical
correctness, but for clarity of writing.  Illegible work or a final
answer given without supporting work shown receives no credit.

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/make_up.html"-->
<h3><a name="Makeup Assignments and Extra Credit">15</a> Makeup Assignments and Extra Credit</h3>

<!-- UPDATE NEEDED each semester: -->
<!-- choose and insert a cutoff date for the last few quizzes -->

<p>
A makeup quiz will be given during the final exam period for anyone who
has missed three or more quizzes before 4/7, or who has missed 1 or more
quizzes after 4/7 (this applies to all missed quizzes, whether or not
the missed quiz grade is excused; see the
section <a href="#Attendance">"Attendance"</a> regarding excused
absences). The makeup quiz will be up to twice as long as quizzes given
before final exam week.

<p>
  
A makeup comprehensive final exam will be given during the final exam
period for anyone who has missed five or more quizzes before
final exam week. The makeup comprehensive final exam covers all of the semester
material. The makeup comprehensive final exam will count the same as
the total of the missed quizzes.

<p>

Format and instructions for a makeup quiz or makeup comprehensive final
exam will be announced in advance.

<p>

There are no makeup pre-class assignments. There are no extra credit assignments.


<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/letter_grades.html"-->
<a name="LetterGrades"></a>
<h3><a name="Letter Grades">16</a> Letter Grades</h3>

<h4>Meaning of letter grades</h4>

According to the College Catalog, letter grades have the following
meanings.

<pre>
   Letter Grade     Meaning
   ------------     ------
        A           excellent
        B           good
        C           satisfactory
        D           requirements and standards met at a minimum level
        F           course requirements not met
</pre>

Standards for "excellent" and "good" (letter grades A and B) are high.
In this course, your grade reflects your proficiency with the material.  A good
grade is not guaranteed by class attendance and performing the motions of
homework; to earn an A or a B, you must demonstrate understanding that
transcends mere rote familiarity.

<h4>Determination of letter grade</h4>

At the end of the semester, your final cumulative average is used to
assign a letter grade.  The scale used to convert cumulative averages to
letter grades is based on the "standard 10 point scale" (A-,A,A+ for
90 to 100 percent range, B-,B,B+ for percentages in the 80's, C-,C,C+
for the 70's, etc.), but the scale may be adjusted, at the discretion of
the instructor, so that the meanings of the letter grades fit the
descriptions given in the previous section. Pluses and minuses are used
to distinguish between the low, middle and high achievers within each
letter grade category.

<p>
<i>Note on mid-term grades:</i> Pluses and minuses are not used for
midterm grades.



<h2><a name="Policies"></a> Policies</h2>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/attendance.html"-->
<h3><a name="Attendance">17</a> Attendance</h3>

Class attendance is expected, but it is understood that sometimes there
are reasonable circumstances for absence. For most students, there is no
grade for attendance or participation (see the exception for "chronic
absenteeism" below), but it is expected that each student will exercise
good judgment for choosing to miss a class.

<p>

Absence from class may be excused, at the discretion of the instructor, for
certain events planned in advance or for emergency or illness. Here is
the procedure to follow if you wish to have an absence excused.
<ul>
<li>Send the instructor email notice of your absence as far as
  possible in advance, with a complete
  explanation for the purpose of your conflicting event.
    <li>In the case of illness or emergency where advance
      notice is not possible, send an email message as soon as it is
      practically possible. Except for extreme circumstances, your email
      notice is due by 5pm on the day of the absence. Collect
      documentation (doctor's notes, etc)
      and send them to the instructor by email.
</ul>

<p>

You will receive a grade of "Excused" for a quiz that you miss on a day
when you have an excused absence. An "Excused" grade does not count for
you or against you in your cumulative average. You will receive a grade
of zero for a quiz that you miss on a day when you have an unexcused
absence. Absence does not change the due date for pre-class assignments.

<p>

  <b>Policy for chronic absenteeism:</b> Chronic unexcused absence has a
  negative impact on classroom learning. The instructor may elect to
  impose a grade deduction for each unexcused absence beyond the
  third. Communication will be made by email when this policy is in
  effect.

<!-- class discussion turned off -->
<!--@DONOTinclude "../../syllabus_common/class_discussion.html"-->
<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/class_engagement.html"-->
<h3><a name="Class Engagement">18</a> Class Engagement</h3>
  
The purpose of class meetings is to pursue understanding and proficiency
with the course material. This requires mental presence, engagement with
the subject, and participation. Class meetings presume respect,
politeness, and kindness among all those in attendance. In consideration
for the learning environment, please observe the following.

<ul>
<!--  <li>Online attendees must have video on.-->
<li>No food is allowed during class.
<li>Use electronic devices only for engaging with the course
  material. For example, note-taking, calculating, and looking up facts
  related to the class discussion are positive activities; text
  messaging, social media browsing, and web surfing are rude behaviors
  that distract everyone from focusing.
  <li>Except for emergencies, please do not leave the class meeting once class
  begins. If you need to leave before the end of class, please inform
  the instructor before class begins.
</ul>


<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/collaboration.html"-->
<h3><a name="Collaboration versus Plagiarism">19</a> Collaboration versus Plagiarism</h3>

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and ask questions of
the instructor or consult any source for homework. You must work hard to
avoid plagiarism, which is presenting someone else's ideas or work as
your own.  <b>The work you submit must be your own.</b> Your writing
must be your own voice and your own understanding.  You must use proper
academic citation for any material created by others.  Plagiarism is a
serious academic offense; penalties range from failing the course to
expulsion from the college.
<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/honor_policy.html"-->
<h3><a name="Honor Policy">20</a> Honor Policy</h3>

It is expected that each student in this class will act with honesty and 
academic integrity.  Instances of academic dishonesty will be pursued as
described in the College Catalog and Student Handbook.

<h2><a name="Learning and Study"></a> Learning and Study</h2>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/learning.html"-->
<a name="Learning"></a>
<h3><a name="Learning">21</a> Learning</h3>

The process of reading, learning vocabulary, solving problems, and writing
is the only way to achieve real understanding and skills. No one else
can read, think, or write for you. It can be very helpful to watch other
people solve problems and explain ideas in class, in a video, in a study
group, or in a tutoring session, but there is no substitute for study
that you do yourself.

<p>

The time expectation for out-of-class work is two hours outside of class for
every one hour of class meeting time. Plan your study time in your weekly
schedule. 

<p>

The quality of your out-of-class study translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little study time guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality studying guarantees a positive learning
experience. Here is an outline of the work flow for each section in the text(s).

<p>

  <ul>
  <li><b>BEFORE class discussion</b>
  <ul>
	<li><b>Read</b> the text material indicated on
	  the course calendar.
	  <li><b>Write</b> vocabulary study cards (or study lists) for
	    terminology, facts, and formulas from the new text
	    section. 
	    <li><b>Solve</b> at least a few of the problems
	      from the new text section.
	      <li><b>Note</b> your questions, problems, and
	      difficulties. In the reading, where, precisely, do you
	      have trouble understanding? With the problems, what,
		precisely, is obstructing you from completing a
		solution?
  </ul>
    <li><b>AFTER class discussion</b>
  <ul>
		<li><b>Reread</b> text material from previous
		  class meetings.
		    <li><b>Revise</b> your vocabulary and
		    fact note cards; make sure your vocabulary list is complete.		  
		  <li><b>Solve and check solutions</b> to all of the problems listed in
		  the "Reading and Problem List" in the
		  syllabus. Prepare complete written solutions, using
		  complete sentences. Compare your solutions to the
		  answer keys in the text(s) and solutions manual(s).
  </ul>
    <li><b>BEFORE the quiz</b>
  <ul>		      
		      <li><b>Assess</b> your progress and proficiency. Have
		      you addressed all the questions and difficulties
			noted previously?
		      <li><b>Rehearse vocabulary</b> using the cards or
		      lists you have prepared. 
		      <li><b>Practice</b> solving problems using a timer.
			<li><b>Follow up</b> on any questions or gaps
			that remain.
  </ul>
    <li><b>AFTER the quiz</b>
  <ul>		      
		      <li><b>Assess</b> (again!) your progress and
		      proficiency. Rework and check solutions to all quiz
		      problems for which you received less than full
			credit.
			<li><b>Follow up</b> (again!) on any questions or gaps
			that remain.
  </ul>

  </ul>


<h3><a name="Study Strategies">22</a> Study Strategies</h3>

<ul>
<li>Plan for two hours of study outside of class for each hour of class.
<li>Keep an organized paper binder or electronic notebook with reading notes, homework solutions, and
  class notes (see the <a href="#Portfolio">Portfolio</a> section below). Mark your questions clearly with sticky notes or some
  other device and follow up every question, either in class
  or in office hours, until you gain understanding.
<li>After reading, summarize the material in your own words.
<li>Use flash cards or lists to learn
  vocabulary. Write each term on one side of a card. Write a definition
  (using complete sentences, not sentence fragments) and an example on
  the back of the card.
<li>To prepare for quizzes and exams, do the following, beginning some
  days to a week in advance.
<ul>
<li>Make an outline of course topics and problem types.
<li>Memorize vocabulary, including examples.
<li>Work and check solutions to problems from previous quizzes, exams,
  and homework.
</ul>
<li>If clock management during exams is an issue, practice working a few
  exam style problems once a week with a timer running.
<li>If test anxiety has a negative effect on your performance, here
  is <a href="http://www.studygs.net/tstprp8.htm">some advice</a>.
    <li>Do not become sleep deprived. Trading sleep for study time is
      counterproductive.
      <li>Eat a healthy diet and exercise every day. Eating poorly and
      lack of physical activity reduce your mental abilities.
</ul>


<h3><a name="Sample Study Aids">23</a> Sample Study Aids</h3>

    and Weekly Planner</a> sample forms
</ul>

<a name="Portfolio"></a>
<h3><a name="Portfolio">24</a> Portfolio</h3>

Keep your work organized. Use electronic or hard copy media, whatever
works best for you. Whatever method you use, it should be designed to
facilitate sorting, searching, planning, and tracking. A complete
portfolio includes:
<ul>
  <li>Progress tracking sheets
  <li>Vocabulary notecards or study sheets
  <li>Reading and class notes
  <li>Solved problems
</ul>
The portfolio is an essential tool for learning; it is also an essential
instrument for diagnosis and improvement. Bring your portfolio to office
hours visits.

<p>
There is no specific portfolio grade. However, a consistent, thorough,
and complete portfolio will influence the letter grade assignment for a
cumulative average near a grade cutoff borderline (see
the <a href="#LetterGrades">Letter Grades</a> section below). For
example, if two students both have an 86% cumulative average, the
student who has shown a consistently thorough portfolio during office
hours might receive a B+, while the other student might receive a B.

<b>QR Criteria & Learning Outcomes</b>
                                                        
<ul>
<li>  Students will understand information presented in mathematical forms
(e.g., equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words), including the
ability to learn about and interpret unfamiliar quantitative structures.
                                                
<li>Students will convert relevant information into various mathematical
forms (e.g., equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words).

<li>Students will make judgments and draw appropriate conclusions based on
the quantitative analysis of data, while recognizing the assumptions
used and other limits of the analysis.

<li>Students will clearly express the results of the interpretation,
representation, application, and analysis of quantitative information in
an effective format.

<li>Courses must have a significant and continuing focus on working with
quantitative arguments.
