<h2><a name="Grades"></a> Grades</h2>

<!--@include "graded_work_3XX.html"-->
<h3><a name="Graded Work">11</a> Graded Work</h3>

Your cumulative average is determined by graded work in the categories listed
below with the indicated weights. Details and instructions are given in
the sections that follow.

<pre>
  Daily Participation    20%
  Written Assignments    40%
  Exams                  40%

<!--@include "seminar_participation.html"-->
<h3><a name="Daily Participation">12</a> Daily Participation</h3>

Daily participation consists of presenting solutions to problems and
participating in discussion of presentations made by other students and
the instructor. Presentations will be graded for effort and
completeness, but not for correctness. Because the list of problems and
the roster rotation is known in advance, students will usually be able to plan
ahead and coordinate who will present which problem. In the case that
one's pre-prepared problem is already "taken", the presenter will
display a positive spirit and make an honest attempt at improvising a
solution to a new problem. Here is the grading rubric.

<p>

  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Daily presentations</th>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Category</b></th>

  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> Complete</td>
    <td> Presentations are fully prepared in a
      way that shows a good faith effort to thoroughly complete the
      assignment. In case of a last-minute problem change, the presenter
      makes an honest attempt and improvises in a positive spirit.

<!--@include "written_work_grading.html"-->
<h3><a name="Writing Assignments">13</a> Writing Assignments</h3>

Writing assignments must be typed and must use appropriate mathematical
symbols and typesetting conventions. Handwritten solutions will not be
accepted. Your writing assignment will be graded for correctness in the following ways:
for correct use of vocabulary and notation; for correct logical flow in your
argument; and for the correct final conclusion(s). The grading rubric
for each written solution is the same as for the "Exam Grading Rubric"
(below) with the addition of the following in the description of the top
category called "complete and correct".

<blockquote>
  The written solution is typed and uses appropriate mathematical
    symbols and typesetting conventions.
</blockquote>

<!--@include "exams_3XX.html"-->
<h3><a name="Exams">14</a> Exams</h3>

Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. In keeping with College
policy, the final exam can only be taken at the officially scheduled
time during final exams week.

<p>
  
For full credit, exam solutions must show not just final results, but
also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work and using appropriate
vocabulary that you understand the reasoning involved. Solutions must be
written in narrative form, using one or more complete sentences.
Solutions will be graded not only for mathematical correctness, but for
clarity of writing.  Illegible work or a final answer given without
supporting work shown receives no credit.

<p>

No music listening devices or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during quizzes or exams. If you need to leave the
classroom during an exam, you must leave your cell phone at the
instructor's desk in the front of the room.

<p>

Here is the rubric for each exam problem solution. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.

<a name="LetterGrades"></a>
<h3><a name="Letter Grades">16</a> Letter Grades</h3>

<h4>Meaning of letter grades</h4>

According to the College Catalog, letter grades have the following
meanings.

<pre>
   Letter Grade     Meaning
   ------------     ------
        A           excellent
        B           good
        C           satisfactory
        D           requirements and standards met at a minimum level
        F           course requirements not met
</pre>

Standards for "excellent" and "good" (letter grades A and B) are high.
In this course, your grade reflects your proficiency with the material.  A good
grade is not guaranteed by class attendance and performing the motions of
homework; to earn an A or a B, you must demonstrate understanding that
transcends mere rote familiarity.

<h4>Determination of letter grade</h4>

At the end of the semester, your final cumulative average is used to
assign a letter grade.  The scale used to convert cumulative averages to
letter grades is based on the "standard 10 point scale" (A-,A,A+ for
90 to 100 percent range, B-,B,B+ for percentages in the 80's, C-,C,C+
for the 70's, etc.), but the scale may be adjusted, at the discretion of
the instructor, so that the meanings of the letter grades fit the
descriptions given in the previous section. Pluses and minuses are used
to distinguish between the low, middle and high achievers within each
letter grade category.

<p>
<i>Note on mid-term grades:</i> Pluses and minuses are not used for
midterm grades.



<h2><a name="Policies"></a> Policies</h2>

<!--@include "attendance_3XX.html"-->
<h3><a name="Attendance">17</a> Attendance</h3>

Class attendance is expected, but it is understood that sometimes there
are reasonable circumstances for absence. For most students, there is no
grade for attendance or participation (see the exception for "chronic
absenteeism" below), but it is expected that each student will exercise
good judgment for choosing to miss a class.

<p>

Absence from an exam may be excused, at the discretion of the instructor, for
certain events planned in advance or for emergency or illness. (If you
are quarantined, you make take the exam online.) Here is
the procedure to follow if you wish to have an exam absence excused.
<ul>
<li>Send the instructor email notice of your exam absence as far as
  possible in advance of the missed exam, with a complete
  explanation for the purpose of your conflicting event.
    <li>In the case of illness or emergency where advance
      notice is not possible, send an email message as soon as it is
      practically possible. Except for extreme circumstances, your email
      notice is due by 5pm on the day of the missed exam. Collect
      documentation (doctor's notes, etc)
      and send them to the instructor by email.
</ul>

<p>

Absence does not change the due date for any graded work. 

<p>

  <b>Policy for chronic absenteeism:</b> Chronic unexcused absence has a
  negative impact on classroom learning. The instructor may elect to
  impose a grade deduction for each unexcused absence beyond the
  third. Communication will be made by email when this policy is in
  effect.

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/class_engagement.html"-->
<h3><a name="Class Engagement">18</a> Class Engagement</h3>
  
The purpose of class meetings is to pursue understanding and proficiency
with the course material. This requires mental presence, engagement with
the subject, and participation. Class meetings presume respect,
politeness, and kindness among all those in attendance. In consideration
for the learning environment, please observe the following.

<ul>
<!--  <li>Online attendees must have video on.-->
<li>No food is allowed during class.
<li>Use electronic devices only for engaging with the course
  material. For example, note-taking, calculating, and looking up facts
  related to the class discussion are positive activities; text
  messaging, social media browsing, and web surfing are rude behaviors
  that distract everyone from focusing.
  <li>Except for emergencies, please do not leave the class meeting once class
  begins. If you need to leave before the end of class, please inform
  the instructor before class begins.
</ul>


<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/collaboration.html"-->
<h3><a name="Collaboration versus Plagiarism">19</a> Collaboration versus Plagiarism</h3>

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and ask questions of
the instructor or consult any source for homework. You must work hard to
avoid plagiarism, which is presenting someone else's ideas or work as
your own.  <b>The work you submit must be your own.</b> Your writing
must be your own voice and your own understanding.  You must use proper
academic citation for any material created by others.  Plagiarism is a
serious academic offense; penalties range from failing the course to
expulsion from the college.
<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/honor_policy.html"-->
<h3><a name="Honor Policy">20</a> Honor Policy</h3>

It is expected that each student in this class will act with honesty and 
academic integrity.  Instances of academic dishonesty will be pursued as
described in the College Catalog and Student Handbook.

<h2><a name="Learning and Study"></a> Learning and Study</h2>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/learning.html"-->
<a name="Learning"></a>
<h3><a name="Learning">21</a> Learning</h3>

The process of reading, learning vocabulary, solving problems, and writing
is the only way to achieve real understanding and skills. No one else
can read, think, or write for you. It can be very helpful to watch other
people solve problems and explain ideas in class, in a video, in a study
group, or in a tutoring session, but there is no substitute for study
that you do yourself.

<p>

The time expectation for out-of-class work is two hours outside of class for
every one hour of class meeting time. Plan your study time in your weekly
schedule. 

<p>

The quality of your out-of-class study translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little study time guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality studying guarantees a positive learning
experience. Here is an outline of the work flow for each section in the text(s).

<p>

  <ul>
  <li><b>BEFORE class discussion</b>
  <ul>
	<li><b>Read</b> the text material indicated on
	  the course calendar.
	  <li><b>Write</b> vocabulary study cards (or study lists) for
	    terminology, facts, and formulas from the new text
	    section. 
	    <li><b>Solve</b> at least a few of the problems
	      from the new text section.
	      <li><b>Note</b> your questions, problems, and
	      difficulties. In the reading, where, precisely, do you
	      have trouble understanding? With the problems, what,
		precisely, is obstructing you from completing a
		solution?
  </ul>
    <li><b>AFTER class discussion</b>
  <ul>
		<li><b>Reread</b> text material from previous
		  class meetings.
		    <li><b>Revise</b> your vocabulary and
		    fact note cards; make sure your vocabulary list is complete.		  
		  <li><b>Solve and check solutions</b> to all of the problems listed in
		  the "Reading and Problem List" in the
		  syllabus. Prepare complete written solutions, using
		  complete sentences. Compare your solutions to the
		  answer keys in the text(s) and solutions manual(s).
  </ul>
    <li><b>BEFORE the quiz</b>
  <ul>		      
		      <li><b>Assess</b> your progress and proficiency. Have
		      you addressed all the questions and difficulties
			noted previously?
		      <li><b>Rehearse vocabulary</b> using the cards or
		      lists you have prepared. 
		      <li><b>Practice</b> solving problems using a timer.
			<li><b>Follow up</b> on any questions or gaps
			that remain.
  </ul>
    <li><b>AFTER the quiz</b>
  <ul>		      
		      <li><b>Assess</b> (again!) your progress and
		      proficiency. Rework and check solutions to all quiz
		      problems for which you received less than full
			credit.
			<li><b>Follow up</b> (again!) on any questions or gaps
			that remain.
  </ul>

  </ul>


<h3><a name="Study Strategies">22</a> Study Strategies</h3>

<ul>
<li>Plan for two hours of study outside of class for each hour of class.
<li>Keep an organized paper binder or electronic notebook with reading notes, homework solutions, and
  class notes (see the <a href="#Portfolio">Portfolio</a> section below). Mark your questions clearly with sticky notes or some
  other device and follow up every question, either in class
  or in office hours, until you gain understanding.
<li>After reading, summarize the material in your own words.
<li>Use flash cards or lists to learn
  vocabulary. Write each term on one side of a card. Write a definition
  (using complete sentences, not sentence fragments) and an example on
  the back of the card.
<li>To prepare for quizzes and exams, do the following, beginning some
  days to a week in advance.
<ul>
<li>Make an outline of course topics and problem types.
<li>Memorize vocabulary, including examples.
<li>Work and check solutions to problems from previous quizzes, exams,
  and homework.
</ul>
<li>If clock management during exams is an issue, practice working a few
  exam style problems once a week with a timer running.
<li>If test anxiety has a negative effect on your performance, here
  is <a href="http://www.studygs.net/tstprp8.htm">some advice</a>.
    <li>Do not become sleep deprived. Trading sleep for study time is
      counterproductive.
      <li>Eat a healthy diet and exercise every day. Eating poorly and
      lack of physical activity reduce your mental abilities.
</ul>


<h3><a name="Sample Study Aids">23</a> Sample Study Aids</h3>

    and Weekly Planner</a> sample forms
</ul>

<a name="Portfolio"></a>
<h3><a name="Portfolio">24</a> Portfolio</h3>

Keep your work organized. Use electronic or hard copy media, whatever
works best for you. Whatever method you use, it should be designed to
facilitate sorting, searching, planning, and tracking. A complete
portfolio includes:
<ul>
  <li>Progress tracking sheets
  <li>Vocabulary notecards or study sheets
  <li>Reading and class notes
  <li>Solved problems
</ul>
The portfolio is an essential tool for learning; it is also an essential
instrument for diagnosis and improvement. Bring your portfolio to office
hours visits.

<p>
There is no specific portfolio grade. However, a consistent, thorough,
and complete portfolio will influence the letter grade assignment for a
cumulative average near a grade cutoff borderline (see
the <a href="#LetterGrades">Letter Grades</a> section below). For
example, if two students both have an 86% cumulative average, the
student who has shown a consistently thorough portfolio during office
hours might receive a B+, while the other student might receive a B.
