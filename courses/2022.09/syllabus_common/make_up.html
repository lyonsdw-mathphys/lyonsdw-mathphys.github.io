<h3>Makeup Assignments and Extra Credit</h3>

<!-- UPDATE NEEDED each semester: -->
<!-- choose and insert a cutoff date for the last few quizzes -->

<p>
A missed quiz due to an absence may be excused, at the discretion of the
instructor (see the section <a href="#Attendance">"Attendance"</a>,
below). A makeup quiz will be given during the final exam period for
anyone who has been excused from three or more quizzes before 11/20, or
who has been excused from 1 or more quizzes after 11/20. The makeup quiz
is optional for everyone else. The makeup quiz will count the same as
any other quiz. Anyone who is excused from four or more quizzes will
take a makeup comprehensive final exam that covers all of the semester
material. The makeup comprehensive final exam will count the same as
the total of the excused quizzes. Subject matter, format, and
instructions for a makeup quiz or makeup comprehensive final exam will
be announced in advance.

<p>

There are no makeup homework assignments. There are no extra credit assignments.
