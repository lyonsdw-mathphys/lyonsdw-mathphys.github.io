<h3>Makeup Assignments and Extra Credit</h3>

<p>
A missed quiz due to an absence may be excused, at the discretion of the
instructor (see the section <a href="#Attendance">"Attendance"</a>,
below). A makeup quiz will be given during the final exam period for
anyone who has been excused from three or more quizzes before the last
two weeks of the semester, or who has been excused from 1 or more of the
last two in-class quizzes. The makeup quiz is optional for everyone
else. The makeup quiz will count the same as any other quiz. Anyone who
is excused from four or more quizzes will take a make-up comprehensive
final exam that covers all of the semester material. The make-up
comprehensive final exam will count the same as the total of the excused
quizzes. Subject matter, format, and instructions for a makeup quiz or
makeup comprehensive final exam will be announced in advance.

<p>

There are no makeup homework assignments. There are no extra credit assignments.
