<h3>Graded Homework</h3>

Homework is reading course material and solving problems. Each graded daily
homework assignment is to show evidence of progress by submitting
written solutions for at least two problems.
Daily homework submissions are due before midnight on
  <i>the day before</i> every class meeting except for days marked
  "Workshop" on the Course Calendar.  You may choose any problems you prefer from
  the sections listed on the Course Calendar for the <i>next</i> class
  meeting after the homework is due.

  <h4>Homework Assignment Submission Instructions</h4>

Submit homework assignments online on Canvas. All solutions must be
written using one or more complete sentences. Homework may be typed or
written by hand. Homework must be submitted as a single pdf file,
  whether it is handwritten or typed (pdf scanning is a built-in utility
  for iphones and android phones).  Work is not accepted late. There are no makeup
assignments.

<h4>Homework Standards and Grading</h4>

  Homework assignments will be graded for preparation and completeness,
    not for correctness. Here is the rubric for graded homework
assignments.
