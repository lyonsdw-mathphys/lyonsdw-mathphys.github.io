<h3>Graded Homework</h3>

Homework is reading course material, mastering definitions of terms
and statements of facts and formulas, solving problems, checking your
solutions, and following up on questions. Only a small bit of homework
is graded. Before midnight on <i>the day before</i> each class meeting, except for days marked
"Workshop" on the Course Calendar, you will show evidence of engagement with the text by submitting at
least two vocabulary study items (terminology, facts, or formulas) for the text section(s) listed on the
Course Calendar for the <i>next</i> day's class meeting. For each
vocabulary item, give a definition of the term or a statement of the
fact or formula using one or more complete sentences, and give an
example. <a href="../../syllabus_common/Sample_Notecards.pdf">Here</a>
are some sample vocabulary notecards.

  <h4>Homework Assignment Submission Instructions</h4>

Submit homework assignments online on Canvas. All vocabulary items must be
written using one or more complete sentences. Homework may be typed or
written by hand. Homework must be submitted as a single pdf file,
  whether it is handwritten or typed (pdf scanning is a built-in utility
  for iphones and android phones).  Work is not accepted late. There are no makeup
assignments.

<h4>Homework Standards and Grading</h4>

  Homework assignments will be graded for preparation and completeness,
    not for correctness. Here is the rubric for graded homework
assignments.
