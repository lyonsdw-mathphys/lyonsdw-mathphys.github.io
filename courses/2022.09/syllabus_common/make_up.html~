<h3>Makeup Assignments and Extra Credit</h3>

<p>
  Missed quizzes may be excused, at the discretion of the instructor. A
  last quiz will be given during the final exam period for anyone who
  has been excused from three quizzes before 11/20 or who has been
  excused from 1 or more quizzes after 11/20. The last quiz is optional
  for everyone else. The extra quiz will count the same as any other
  quiz. Anyone who is excused from four or more quizzes
  will take a make-up comprehensive final exam. The make-up
  comprehensive final exam will count the same as the total of the
  excused quizzes.

<p>

There are no makeup homework assignments. There are no extra credit assignments.
