<h3>Learning</h3>

The process of reading, mastering vocabulary, solving problems, and writing
is the only way to achieve real understanding and skills. No one else
can read, think, or write for you. It can be very helpful to watch other
people solve problems and explain ideas in class, in a video, in a study
group, or in a tutoring session, but there is no substitute for study
that you do yourself.

<p>

The time expectation for out-of-class work is two hours outside of class for
every hour of class meeting time. Plan your study time in your weekly
schedule. 

<p>

The quality of your out-of-class study translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little study time guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality studying guarantees a positive learning
experience. Here is an outline of the work flow for each section in the text(s).

<p>

  <ul>
  <li><b>BEFORE class discussion</b>
  <ul>
	<li><b>Read</b> the text section(s) indicated on
	  the course calendar.
	  <li><b>Write</b> vocabulary study cards (or study lists) for
	    terminology, facts, and formulas from the new text
	    section. 
	    <li><b>Solve</b> at least a few of the low numbered problems
	      from the new text section.
	      <li><b>Note</b> your questions, problems, and
	      difficulties. In the reading, where, precisely, do you
	      have trouble understanding? With the problems, what,
		precisely, is obstructing you from completing a
		solution?
  </ul>
    <li><b>AFTER class discussion</b>
  <ul>
		<li><b>Reread</b> text sections listed for previous
		  class meetings.
		    <li><b>Revise</b> your vocabulary and
		    fact note cards; make sure your vocabulary list is complete.		  
		  <li><b>Solve and check solutions</b> to all of the problems listed in
		  the "Reading and Problem List" in the
		  syllabus. Prepare complete written solutions, using
		  complete sentences. Compare your solutions to the
		  answer keys in the text(s) and solutions manual(s).
  </ul>
    <li><b>BEFORE the quiz</b>
  <ul>		      
		      <li><b>Assess</b> your progress and mastery. Have
		      you addressed all the questions and difficulties
			noted previously?
		      <li><b>Rehearse vocabulary</b> using the cards or
		      lists you have prepared. 
		      <li><b>Practice</b> solving problems using a timer.
			<li><b>Follow up</b> on any questions or gaps
			that remain.
  </ul>
    <li><b>AFTER the quiz</b>
  <ul>		      
		      <li><b>Assess</b> (again!) your progress and
		      mastery. Rework and check solutions to all quiz
		      problems for which you received less than full
			credit.
			<li><b>Follow up</b> (again!) on any questions or gaps
			that remain.
  </ul>

  </ul>


<h3>Study Strategies</h3>

<ul>
<li>Plan for two hours of study outside of class for each hour of class.
<li>Keep an organized paper binder or electronic notebook with reading notes, homework solutions, and
  class notes (see the <a href="#Portfolio">Portfolio</a> section below). Mark your questions clearly with sticky notes or some
  other device and follow up every question, either in class
  or in office hours, until you gain understanding.
<li>After reading, summarize the material in your own words.
<li>Use flash cards or lists to learn
  vocabulary. Write each term on one side of a card. Write a definition
  (using complete sentences, not sentence fragments) and an example on
  the back of the card.
<li>To prepare for quizzes and exams, do the following, beginning some
  days to a week in advance.
<ul>
<li>Make an outline of course topics and problem types.
<li>Memorize vocabulary, including examples.
<li>Work and check solutions to problems from previous quizzes, exams,
  and homework.
</ul>
<li>If clock management during exams is an issue, practice working a few
  exam style problems once a week with a timer running.
<li>If test anxiety has a negative effect on your performance, here
  is <a href="http://www.studygs.net/tstprp8.htm">some advice</a>.
    <li>Do not become sleep deprived. Trading sleep for study time is
      counterproductive.
      <li>Eat a healthy diet and exercise every day. Eating poorly and
      lack of physical activity reduce your mental abilities.
</ul>

<h3>Portfolio</h3>

Keep your work organized. Use electronic or hard copy media, whatever
works best for you. Whatever method you use, it should be designed to
facilitate sorting, searching, planning, and tracking. A complete
portfolio includes the following:
<ul>
  <li>Calendars, weekly planners, progress tracking sheets
  <li>Vocabulary notecards
  <li>Reading and class notes
  <li>Solved problems
  <li>Completed quizzes
</ul>
Bring your portfolio to office hours and to "workshop" class days if you
wish to discuss class performance.
