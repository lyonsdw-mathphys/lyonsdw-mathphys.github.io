<h3>Gradebook</h3>

The Canvas gradebook keeps scores only for your regular
homework. Scores for other assignments, including exams, and also your
current cumulative average, are maintained by the instructor, but are
not recorded in Canvas.

<p>
  
You will receive regular grade update reports from the instructor by
email.
