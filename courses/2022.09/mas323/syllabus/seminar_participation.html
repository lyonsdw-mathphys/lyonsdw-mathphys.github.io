<h3>Daily Participation</h3>

Daily participation consists of presenting solutions to problems and
participating in discussion of presentations made by other students and
the instructor. Presentations will be graded for effort and
completeness, but not for correctness. Because the list of problems and
the roster rotation is known in advance, students will usually be able to plan
ahead and coordinate who will present which problem. In the case that
one's pre-prepared problem is already "taken", the presenter will
display a positive spirit and make an honest attempt at improvising a
solution to a new problem. Here is the grading rubric.

      assignment. In case of a last-minute problem change, the presenter
      makes an honest attempt and improvises in a positive spirit.
