<!-- new spring 2026, non-gen-ed courses have looser pre-class exercise
    assignments, specific problems are not attached to specific due
    dates   -->

<h3>Graded Exercises</h3>

Reading the text(s) and solving problems is the largest part of your
work in this course, and most of that work takes place outside of
class. You will submit written work to demonstrate evidence of your
progress in reading and problem solving and to prepare for each class
meeting. This work will be graded for effort and completeness, but not
for correctness (see the rubric below).


<p>

Most of the sections (or chapters) of the text(s) (see
the <a href="#reading_and_exercises">Reading and Exercises</a> section
above) are spread out over more than one class meeting. Class days are
labeled A, B, C, etc to indicate where you should aim to be within each
section or chapter.

<pre>
  A  the first half of the reading and exercises
  B  the second half of the reading and exercises
  C  more solutions not yet submitted for A and B
  D  more solutions not yet submitted for A, B, C
  </pre>

<p>
  
The length expectation for each submission is one page minimum, but you are allowed to submit
more than one page. There is no specified list of problems for submitted
written work for any given section or chapter; it is your job to choose
about a page of solutions for each assignment. Keep in mind that you are
responsible for understanding and proficiency in all of the reading and
exercises, even though you will submit only a fraction of the solutions.

<p>

Your work may be typed or written by hand. Your work must be submitted
as a single pdf file, whether it is handwritten or typed.  Work is not
accepted late. There are no makeup assignments.

<p>

Solutions will be graded for preparation and completeness, not for
correctness. For full credit, solutions must show evidence that you
have read the material and must show evidence of your thinking and
understanding.  You are not expected to solve all of the problems
perfectly, but you are expected to try.
