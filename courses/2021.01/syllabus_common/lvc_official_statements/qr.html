<i>The following description of the Quantitative Reasoning (QR)
  component of LVC's Constellation program (general education) is quoted from the LVC website and documents
  from the office of the Dean of the Faculty. It is clear that the QR

<b>Description of Quantitative Reasoning Courses:</b>
Reason about and solve quantitative problems from a wide array of
contexts. Read, understand, and create arguments supported by
quantitative evidence and clearly communicate those arguments using a
variety of formats. Learn to make judgments and draw appropriate
conclusions based on the quantitative analysis of data.

<b>Criteria & Learning Outcomes</b>
                                                        
<ul>
<li>  Students will understand information presented in mathematical forms
(e.g., equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words), including the
ability to learn about and interpret unfamiliar quantitative structures.
                                                
<li>Students will convert relevant information into various mathematical
forms (e.g., equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words).

<li>Students will make judgments and draw appropriate conclusions based on
the quantitative analysis of data, while recognizing the assumptions
used and other limits of the analysis.

<li>Students will clearly express the results of the interpretation,
representation, application, and analysis of quantitative information in
an effective format.

<li>Courses must have a significant and continuing focus on working with
quantitative arguments.
</ul>
