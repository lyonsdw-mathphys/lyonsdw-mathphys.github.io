<h3>Quantitative Reasoning (QR)</h3>

Reason about and solve quantitative problems from a wide array of
contexts. Read, understand, and create arguments supported by
quantitative evidence and clearly communicate those arguments using a
variety of formats. Learn to make judgments and draw appropriate
conclusions based on the quantitative analysis of data.

<b>Criteria & Learning Outcomes</b>
                                                        
<ul>
<li>  Students will understand information presented in mathematical forms
(e.g., equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words), including the
ability to learn about and interpret unfamiliar quantitative structures.
                                                
<li>Students will convert relevant information into various mathematical
forms (e.g., equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words).

<li>Students will make judgments and draw appropriate conclusions based on
the quantitative analysis of data, while recognizing the assumptions
used and other limits of the analysis.

<li>Students will clearly express the results of the interpretation,
representation, application, and analysis of quantitative information in
an effective format.

<li>Courses must have a significant and continuing focus on working with
quantitative arguments.
