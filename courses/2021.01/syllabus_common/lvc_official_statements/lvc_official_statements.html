<h2>LVC Official Academic Policy Statements</h2>

<i>(from the office of the Dean of the Faculty)</i>

<h3>Respondus or ExamSoft Policy</h3>

<q>In this course, you may be asked to use a custom browser that locks down
the testing environment within the Canvas learning management
system. While using these programs, your instructor may require you to
activate the video camera and microphone of your computer while
completing the exam. Students who are not willing to provide the
requested video and audio feeds may ask to take the exam using an
alternative proctoring method. Students may arrange for the exam to be
proctored at a professional testing center such as Sylvan Learning
Centers. The student is responsible for finding the testing site and
must pay any fees associated with testing. The Alternate Proctoring
Request form can be obtained by contacting Kristen Shutter
atshutter@lvc.edu or by phone at 717-867-6028.
</q>

<h3>Expectations for Students in Face-to-Face Class Sessions</h3>

Students participating in face-to-face class sessions must adhere to the
guidelines put forth in LVC’s Community Covenant
(http://wordpress.lvc.edu/wordpress/lvcforward/2020/07/09/community-covenant/).To
facilitate contact tracing, students will be given assigned seats for
the semester.

<h3>Policy on Recording Class Sessions</h3>

Audio and/or video recordings of the class sessions may be made by the
College and/or by students who have been authorized by the LVC Center
for Accessibility Resources to record classes as an accommodation for a
disability. By participating in the class, all students consent to
being recorded for these purposes. Any other recordings of class
sessions are not permitted. Students participating in on-line courses
are asked to respect the privacy of those participating in the class by
ensuring that class sessions cannot be overheard by those who are not
enrolled in the course.

<h3>Academic Honesty Policy</h3>

Any student who submits plagiarized work will be subject to the
penalties described in the Student Handbook and the College Catalog and
outlined in LVC’s Academic Honesty
Policy. (https://www.lvc.edu/academics/academic-resources/college-catalogue/college-academic-policies-and-procedures/academic-honesty/)

<p>

<b>This code asks each student to do his/her own work in his/her own words.</b>

<p>
  
A student shall neither hinder nor unfairly assist the efforts of other
students to complete their work. All individual work that a student
produces and submits as a course assignment must be the student’s
own. Cheating and plagiarism are acts of academic dishonesty.

<p>

Cheating is an act that deceives or defrauds. It includes, but is not
limited to, looking at another’s exam or quiz, using unauthorized
materials during an exam or quiz, colluding on assignments without the
permission or knowledge of the instructor, and furnishing false
information for the purpose of receiving special consideration, such as
postponement of an exam, essay, quiz or deadline of an oral
presentation.

<p>
  
Plagiarism is the act of submitting as one’s own, the work (the words,
ideas, images, or compositions) of another person or persons without
accurate attribution. Plagiarism can manifest itself in various ways: it
can arise from sloppy note-taking; it can emerge as the incomplete or
incompetent citation of resources; it can take the form of the wholesale
submission of other people’s work as one’s own, whether from an online,
oral or printed source.

<p>
  
Students who take part in violations such as cheating or plagiarism are
subject to a meeting with the Assistant Dean and Director of
Constellation, who has the authority to take further action, up to and
including expulsion from the College.

<p>
  
  <h3>End of Term Course Evaluations</h3>

Most courses at the College utilize a course evaluation system called
EvaluationKIT. Near the end of the term, you will have the opportunity
to evaluate the course in a number of key areas: learning environment,
instructor performance, overall course structure, progress on relevant
course objectives, and Constellation learning outcomes (if they
apply). The faculty have approved a set of common questions that
students will respond using an agreement scale. Please note that
quantitative survey results and comments are used for course and
instructor improvements and to indirectly measure the progress on
relevant student learning objectives.  


  <h3>Policies Regarding Accessibility Resources</h3>

Policies Regarding Students with Disabilities
Individuals with disabilities are guaranteed certain protections and
rights of equal access to programs and activities under Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act
Amendments Act (ADAAA) of 2008. Therefore, Lebanon Valley College
recognizes the responsibility of the college community to provide equal
educational access for otherwise qualified students with disabilities.

<p>
  
In-Person and Online Courses: Any student who needs accommodations is
invited to provide letters from the Center for Accessibility Resources
and discuss accommodations with me.
Any student who feels they may need accommodations based on a documented
disability or other condition that may affect academic performance
should: contact The Center for Accessibility Resources, located in the
Lebegern Learning Commons — Mund Suite 002. Students may schedule an
appointment by calling 717-867-6028 or emailinghannafor@lvc.edu to
determine if accommodations are warranted and to obtain an official
letter of accommodation.

<p>
  
Assistive Technology is available to enhance your academic skills. The
Center for Accessibility Resources, located in the Lebegern Learning
Commons — Mund Suite 002, offers educational software and personal
assistive devices for short-term loans. Available assistive devices
include LiveScribe pens, mini iPads, digital recorders, headphones, and
adaptive keyboards. Our student coordinator is available to meet with
students throughout the semester to suggest devices and/or software
aligned to individual student needs.

<p>
  
If a student believes that appropriate accommodations are being denied,
the student may file a grievance. Procedures for filing grievances may
be found
at https://www.lvc.edu/offices-directories/center-for-accessibility-resources

<p>
  
  <h3>Statement on Inclusive Excellence</h3>
  
LVC is a community of inclusive excellence. We affirm the rights of all
persons to a superior educational experience that is characterized by
respect for others. As such, this class and all classes at LVC, are
places where our core values of inclusiveness, civility and appreciation
of difference are affirmed.

  <h3>Policy on Preferred Names and Pronouns</h3>

Lebanon Valley College is committed to fostering an environment of
inclusion and support, which includes honoring all its members’ forms of
self-identification. This policy provides uses of preferred first names
and pronouns for students, faculty, staff, friends, and alumni who wish
to provide them. Many members of the LVC community may use names other
than their legal names to identify themselves. If the use of this
different name is not for misrepresentation, LVC acknowledges that a
preferred name may be used wherever possible. The preferred name will be
recorded and used except where the legal name is required.

<p>
  
Although students, faculty, staff, friends, and alumni are free to
determine the preferred name and pronoun they wish to be known by, the
College deserves the right to deny a preferred name and pronoun if it is
used inappropriately.

<p>
  
Gender pronouns are those pronouns that members of the community use to
represent themselves. Gender pronouns can include, but are not limited
to, he/him/his, she/her/hers, they/them/theirs, etc. Asking for and
correctly using a person’s pronoun is one of the most basic ways to show
respect for a person’s gender identity.

<p>
  
Preferred name and pronouns will be entered and accessible internally
for members of the campus community. Lebanon Valley College expects all
faculty, staff, and students to facilitate the use of preferred names
and pronouns listed on the directory and class rosters.

<h3>Title IX Statement</h3>

Lebanon Valley College prohibits discrimination on the basis of race,
color, national origin, ancestry, religion/creed, sex, pregnancy, sexual
orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, genetic
information, marital/familial status, or veteran status in all programs
and activities, as required by Title IX of the Educational Amendments of
1972, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
and other applicable statutes and/or College policies. Lebanon Valley
College prohibits discriminatory harassment and sexual harassment,
including sexual violence and any type of sexual misconduct.

<p>
  
Title IX makes it clear that violence, harassment, and any type of
sexual misconduct based on sex and gender are civil rights
violations. If you or someone you know has experienced violence,
discrimination, or harassment, support is available through Counseling
Services, Health Service, the Chaplain’s office, the Victim Advocacy
Program, and Title IX deputies. Please refer to the Student Handbook or
the College Catalog for specific contact information.

<h3>Hybrid and Online Instructional Equivalencies</h3>

The faculty of Lebanon Valley College approved guidelines on Equivalent
Instructional Activities that will be used to substitute for
face-to-face contact hour requirements for this online or hybrid
course. These activities are clearly documented in this syllabus. For
further details, the approved equivalencies are published
at www.lvc.edu/offices-directories/registrar/equivalent-instructional-activities.

<h3>Policy on Student Success and Intervention</h3>

CARE Team At Lebanon Valley College, we want you to succeed in and out
of the classroom. Administrators and faculty work together to ensure not
only academic success but a highly-productive and positive
experience. If any LVC staff, administrator, or faculty member is
concerned about you for any reason, they will submit a referral to our
CARE team, and a team member will contact you to collectively work on a
solution. You should consider it your assignment to follow through and
accept assistance from the appropriate source(s). Don’t be afraid or
hesitant to seek help from these individuals: supporting you is their
job! Be proactive and take control of your success.
The Center for Academic Success  Located in the lower-level of Mund
College Center, the Center for Academic Success serves to support,
inspire, and cultivate student success. The key to performing well
academically lies in frequently utilizing support services across
campus; in fact, many of our top students utilize tutors to help prepare
for exams, talk through challenging concepts, learn how to take
effective notes, and more. For this reason, we staff over nearly 300
peer tutors in almost all 100 and 200-level classes, including
subject-specific writing conferencing. We also offer weekly study groups
called "Study Pods" for specific subjects that serve as a place to
connect with classmates, ask questions, and work on homework as well as
drop-in writing support from 7pm-9pm, Mondays through Thursdays. If you
would like to work with a tutor, please fill out a tutor
request form (also located on the CAS website).

<p>

In addition, the Center features an Academic Success Specialist, a
professional staff member who mentors students by designing and
implementing a plan for academic success. These "coaching" sessions
focus on developing effective time management, organizational,
test-taking, critical reading, note-taking, and study skills, as well as
learning healthy behavioral techniques like stress management and
self-motivation. Our Specialist is available anytime over the summer to
meet with you. For more information on any of these services, visit
the Center for Academic Success. To request an appointment, please
email findyoursuccess@lvc.edu.

<h3>Statement on Supporting Mental Health</h3>

Counseling Services Your mental health, including excessive stress,
anxiety, depression or problems with eating and/or sleeping can
adversely influence your academic performance.  At LVC we care about the
whole person. If you feel that any of these issues are negatively
impacting your performance, please contact our Counseling Services to
consult with one of our professional counselors. During a brief phone
conversation, they can assess your particular needs and help you make a
connection to the services you may need.  If you would like a phone
consultation, just email counselingservices@lvc.edu and leave your
contact information. A professional counselor will return your call or
email the next business day.  We will not check email after hours or
over the weekend/vacation times. If you experience an emergency, please
call 911 in your local area or text 741741 to request immediate
assistance.

<p>
  
Many students report that starting the counseling process earlier in the
semester has taught them important coping skills that helped improve
their academics. Click here to explore all Counseling Services has to
offer.
