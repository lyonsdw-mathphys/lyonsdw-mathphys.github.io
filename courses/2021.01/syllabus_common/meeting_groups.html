This class is split into three groups:
<ul>
  <li>Group A: last name begins with A through L
  <li>Group Z: last name begins with M through Z
  <li>Online Only
</ul>

Each class meeting on the Canvas course calendar is labeled by Group A,
Group Z, or neither. Here is a key for when you should attend class in
the classroom or on Zoom.
