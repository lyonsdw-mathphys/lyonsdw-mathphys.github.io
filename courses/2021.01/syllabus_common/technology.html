<h3>Required Technology</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Browser for exams: Chrome or Firefox (Canvas quizzes do not work
    correctly on Safari)
    <li>Online class attendance and office hours: any device running Zoom
</ul>

It is <b>strongly recommended</b> to have a Windows or Mac laptop
computer with a good webcam and microphone, but not strictly
required. If you don't have a Windows or Mac computer with a webcam and
microphone, you will have to make your own arrangements to borrow one,
or pay to use a professional testing service on site, if we use Lockdown
Browswer for exams. Chromebook and Linux laptops may not be able to run
Lockdown Browser.
