<h3>Course Goals, Objectives, and Learning Outcomes</h3>

The primary <a name="goals_etc">goal</a> of the course is <b>mathematical intellectual
growth</b> through the <b>understanding and mastery of mathematical
concepts</b>. Student learning objectives are strength and fluency
in <b>reading</b>, in <b>analysis and problem solving</b>, and
in <b>clear, concise communication</b>. Achievement of goals and
learning objectives requires desire for learning, willingness to work
hard, time commitment (at least two hours on homework outside of class
for each hour in class), and persistence.
