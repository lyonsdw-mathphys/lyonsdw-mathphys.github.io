<h3>Class Discussion</h3>
  
Each class meeting will be organized by a Canvas Discussion where
students will post questions about reading and problems.

<ul>
  <li>Phrase your question using one or more complete sentences.
  <li>Show your partial work (attach a file).
    <li>You may update or withdraw a discussion request by replying to
    your own post. 
    <li>The Discussion opens two days before each class meeting at 5pm.
      <li>No "place holding". This means that you can't reserve a slot
      for a question by posting a question and then replacing it with
      another question when your turn comes up. 
</ul>
