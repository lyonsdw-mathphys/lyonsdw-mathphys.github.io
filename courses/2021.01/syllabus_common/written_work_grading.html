<h3>Writing Assignments</h3>  

Writing assignments will be collected and graded approximately once
each week. Writing assignments must be typed and must use appropriate mathematical
symbols and typesetting conventions. Handwritten solutions will not be
accepted. Your writing assignment will be graded for correctness in the following ways:
for correct use of vocabulary and notation; for correct logical flow in your
argument; and for the correct final conclusion(s).
