<h3>Homework</h3>

Homework is reading course material and solving problems. Each graded daily
homework assignment is to show evidence of progress by submitting
written solutions for at least two problems.
Daily homework submissions are due before midnight on
  <i>the day before</i> every class meeting except for days marked
  "Review", "Exam", and "Workshop" on the Course Calendar.  You may choose any problems you prefer from
  the sections listed on the Course Calendar for the <i>next</i> class
  meeting after the homework is due.

<p>
  
  <h4>Homework Assignment Submission Instructions</h4>

Submit homework
  assignments online on Canvas. All solutions must be written using one
  or more complete sentences. Homework may be typed or written by hand.
Work is not accepted late. There are no makeup assignments.

<p>

  The simplest homework submission method is to take photos on your
  phone---one photo for each page of written solutions. Another possibility
  is to use a scanner. Submit all the homework assignment
  photos or scans as one packet using the Canvas phone app or to 
  the Canvas web site using a computer.

<h4>Homework Standards and Grading</h4>

  Homework assignments will be graded for preparation and completeness,
    not for correctness. Here is the rubric for graded homework
assignments.

      <th colspan="2">Graded Homework Assignment Rubric</th>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Category</b></th>
    <th> Description</b></th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>Complete</td>
    <td> Solutions to problems are fully
      prepared, are written using one or more complete
      sentences for each problem, and are readable. 
    </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>Partially complete</td>
    <td> One or more solutions are not complete or some of the submission is not
   clear enough to be readable.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>No credit</td>
    <td>Solutions show no effort to use complete sentences, are
    unreadable, or are submitted after the deadline. </td>
    </td>
</tr>

<h3>Exams</h3>  

  Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. In keeping with College
policy, the final exam can only be taken at the officially scheduled
  time during final exams week.

<p>

<!--  
No music players or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during quizzes or exams. If you need to leave the
classroom during an exam, you must leave your cell phone at the
instructor's desk in the front of the room.

<p>
  -->
  
For full credit, quiz and exam solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work that you
understand the reasoning involved. Each solution requires 
one or more complete sentences.  Solutions will be graded not only for
mathematical correctness, but for clarity of writing.  Illegible work or
a final answer given without supporting work shown receives no credit.

<p>
  
Exam problem solutions will be graded
using the following rubric. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.

      <th colspan="2">Exam Grading Rubric</th>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Category</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>Complete and Correct</td>
    <td> Solution is complete and correct, shows appropriate work, and uses appropriate
    vocabulary. </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>Nearly complete and correct</td>
    <td> Solution has a small flaw (for example, there's a correct solution method,
    but an arithmetic error throws off the final answer, or an important
    term is missing that should have been mentioned). Solution
    shows understanding of method(s) and issues involved.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>Some progress</td>
    <td> There is some attempt at the problem; there is plausible
    evidence that some aspect of
    the problem is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>No progress</td>
    <td> The response is blank, illegible, or shows
    no plausible evidence that some key aspect of the solution is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

  <i>Note on Canvas exam scoring variations:</i> Exam format and scoring
  methods may vary for online exams. For example, instead of
  free-response, some exam questions
  might be multiple choice, paired with "show your work". Alternative
  formats and scoring methods will be announced in advance of each exam.
