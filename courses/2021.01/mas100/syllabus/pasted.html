Browser for exams. Chromebook and Linux laptops may not be able to run
Lockdown Browser.


<h2>Course Content</h2>
<!--@include "description.html"-->
<h3>Course Description</h3>

This course examines topics in fairness and manipulability in social
decision making including voting systems and division of goods.



<!--@include "reading_and_problems.html"-->
<h3>Reading and Problem List</h3>

Course reading assignments are the text sections listed below. The
amount of problem solving practice needed to achieve mastery varies by
individual. Here are two extremes.

<ul>
<li><b>Maximum practice needed:</b> work all of the end-of-chapter "Skills Check
  Exercises", work all of the odd-numbered "Exercises" for each section
<li><b>Minimum practice needed:</b> work approximately every other odd-numbered 
  problem in the "Exercises" for each section 
</ul>

<h3>Course Goals, Objectives, and Learning Outcomes</h3>

The primary goal of the course is <b>mathematical intellectual
growth</b> through the <b>understanding and mastery of mathematical
concepts</b>. Student learning objectives are strength and fluency
in <b>reading</b>, in <b>analysis and problem solving</b>, and
in <b>clear, concise communication</b>. Achievement of goals and
learning objectives requires desire for learning, willingness to work
hard, time commitment (at least two hours on homework outside of class
for each hour in class), and persistence.

<p>
  
<b>Learning Outcomes Summary</b>. Through the medium of the mathematical concepts of this
course, a student who achieves the course learning objectives will:
<ul>
<li>have increased strength and fluency in reading skills
<li>have increased strength and fluency in analysis and problem solving skills
<li>have increased strength and fluency in clear, concise communication skills
</ul>

<h2>Grades</h2>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/grade_categories_1XX.html"-->
  <h3>Graded Work</h3>
  
Your cumulative average is determined by graded work in the categories listed
below with the indicated weights. Details and instructions are given in
the sections that follow.

    </tr>
  </table>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/graded_hmwk_1XX.html"-->
<h3>Graded Homework</h3>

Homework is reading course material and solving problems. Each graded daily
homework assignment is to show evidence of progress by submitting
written solutions for at least two problems.
Daily homework submissions are due before midnight on
  <i>the day before</i> every class meeting except for days marked
  "Review", "Exam", and "Workshop" on the Course Calendar.  You may choose any problems you prefer from
  the sections listed on the Course Calendar for the <i>next</i> class
  meeting after the homework is due.

<p>
  
  <h4>Homework Assignment Submission Instructions</h4>

Submit homework assignments online on Canvas. All solutions must be
written using one or more complete sentences. Homework may be typed or
written by hand.  Work is not accepted late. There are no makeup
assignments.

<p>

  The simplest homework submission method is to take photos on your
  phone---one photo for each page of written solutions. Another
  possibility is to use a scanner. Submit all the homework assignment
  photos or scans as one packet using the Canvas phone app or to the
  Canvas web site using a computer.

<h4>Homework Standards and Grading</h4>

  Homework assignments will be graded for preparation and completeness,
    not for correctness. Here is the rubric for graded homework
assignments.

<p>

  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Graded Homework Assignment Rubric</th>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Category</b></th>
    <th> Description</b></th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>Complete</td>
    <td> Solutions to problems are fully
      prepared, are written using one or more complete
      sentences for each problem, and are readable. 
    </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>Partially complete</td>
    <td> One or more solutions are not complete or some of the submission is not
   clear enough to be readable.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>No credit</td>
    <td>Solutions show no effort to use complete sentences, are
    unreadable, or are submitted after the deadline. </td>
    </td>
</tr>

</table>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/exam_grading_1XX.html"-->
<h3>Exams</h3>  

Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. In keeping with College
policy, the final exam can only be taken at the officially scheduled
time during final exams week.

<p>

<!--  
No music players or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during quizzes or exams. If you need to leave the
classroom during an exam, you must leave your cell phone at the
instructor's desk in the front of the room.

<p>
  -->
  
For full credit, quiz and exam solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work and using
appropriate vocabulary that you understand the reasoning involved. Each
solution requires one or more complete sentences.  Solutions will be
graded not only for mathematical correctness, but for clarity of
writing.  Illegible work or a final answer given without supporting work
shown receives no credit.

<p>
  
Here is the rubric for each exam problem solution. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.

    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>Complete and correct</td>
    <td> The solution is written using one or more complete sentences,
    shows appropriate work, and uses appropriate
      vocabulary. Calculations and logical reasoning are correct.
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>Substantive progress</td>
    <td> The solution shows understanding of facts, methods, and issues
      involved, but does not meet the description of "complete and
      correct".
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>Some progress</td>
    <td> The response shows plausible
    evidence that some aspect of the problem is grasped, but does not
    meet the description of "substantive progress".
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>No progress</td>
    <td> The response is blank, illegible, or shows
    no plausible evidence that some key aspect of the solution is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>
