<h2>Part 2. Graded Work</h2>

Your cumulative average is determined by graded work in the categories listed
below with the indicated weights. Details and instructions are given in
the sections that follow.

<h3>"Small Things</h3>

Each of the three types of "small" graded items (see descriptions below) will be
graded for effort and completeness, but not for correctness. Here is the
grading rubric.

    <tr>
    <td> 2 points</td>
    <td> Presentations or written submissions are fully prepared in a
      way that shows a good faith effort to thoroughly complete the assignment.
    </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 1 point</td>
    <td> Presentations or written submissions are not fully complete or show
    little effort to thoroughly complete the assignment. </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> Presentations or written submissions are not prepared or not turned in before the deadline. </td>

<h3> Daily participation: your turn in the roster rotation to present a
  problem or a progress report</h3> Class format will consist of daily
  student presentations. In the first half of the course, presentations
  will be solutions to problems in the textbook. In the second half of
  the course, presentations will be progress reports on your individual
  reading project.
  
  <h3>Writing warm up exercise</h3> Your final project write-up will be
  typed, will use proper mathematical symbols and typesetting
  conventions, and will have a proper bibliography. In order to address
  the learning curve inherent in typing mathematical content, there will
  be a short (less than 1 page) writing warm-up exercise.

  <h3>Project write-up proposal, with practice bibliography</h3> Write a
  short (less than 1 page) description of the topic you plan to study
  for your individual project in the second half of the semester. List
  at least two sources in proper bibliographic form. This proposal must
  be typed. It is <i>not</i> supposed to be an outline for your final
  write-up. 

  <h3>Project Write-up</h3> The project write-up is a typed, 2 to 5 page
  report on your individual project investigation. The write-up will use
  proper mathematical symbols and typesetting conventions. The project write-up
  will include the following sections:
  <ul>
    <li>Introduction
      <li>Body
	<li>Conclusion
	  <li>Bibliography (any standard format)
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Exams</h3>  

  Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. In keeping with College
policy, the final exam can only be taken at the officially scheduled
  time during final exams week.

<p>
  
No music players or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during quizzes or exams. If you need to leave the
classroom during an exam, you must leave your cell phone at the
instructor's desk in the front of the room.

<p>

For full credit, quiz and exam solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work that you
understand the reasoning involved.  Solutions to some problems
require responses written using
one or more complete sentences.  Solutions will be graded not only for
mathematical correctness, but for clarity of writing.  Illegible work or
a final answer given without supporting work shown receives no credit.

<p>
  
Exam problem solutions will be graded
using the following 5-point rubric. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.

  <tr>
    <th>Score</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 5 points</td>
    <td> Solution is complete and correct, shows appropriate work, and uses correct
    vocabulary where prompted. </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 4 points</td>
    <td> Solution has a small flaw (for example, there's a correct solution method,
    but an arithmetic error throws off the final answer). Solution
    shows understanding of method(s) and issues involved.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 3 points</td>
    <td> Solution has a "medium" flaw (too large to be "small"), or several small flaws.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 2 points</td>
    <td> Response shows a start on the right direction, or has some part of the
    solution right, but largely goes wrong---too much wrong to earn 3 points.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 1 point</td>
    <td> There is some attempt at the problem; there is plausible
    evidence that some aspect of
    the problem is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> No points are given for a blank response, an illegible
    response, or a final answer (say, for
    a computation) given with no supporting work shown, or if the response
    shows no plausible evidence that some key aspect of the solution is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>
