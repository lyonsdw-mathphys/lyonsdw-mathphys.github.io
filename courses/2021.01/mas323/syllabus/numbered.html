<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/exam_grading_1XX.html"-->
<h3><a name="Exams">3.3</a> Exams</h3>

Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. In keeping with College
policy, the final exam can only be taken at the officially scheduled
time during final exams week.

<p>

<!--  
No music players or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during quizzes or exams. If you need to leave the
classroom during an exam, you must leave your cell phone at the
instructor's desk in the front of the room.

<p>
  -->
  
For full credit, quiz and exam solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work and using
appropriate vocabulary that you understand the reasoning involved. Each
solution requires one or more complete sentences.  Solutions will be
graded not only for mathematical correctness, but for clarity of
writing.  Illegible work or a final answer given without supporting work
shown receives no credit.

<p>
  
Exam problem solutions will be graded
using the following rubric. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.

    <tr>
    <td>Nearly complete and correct</td>
    <td> Solution has a small flaw (for example, there's a correct solution method,
    but an arithmetic error throws off the final answer, or an important
    term is missing that should have been mentioned). Solution
    shows understanding of method(s) and issues involved.</td>

<h2><a name="Policies">4</a> Policies</h2>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/attendance.html"-->
<h3><a name="Attendance">4.1</a> Attendance</h3>

Class attendance is expected, but it is understood that sometimes there
are reasonable circumstances for absence. There is no
grade for attendance or participation, but it is expected that each
student will exercise good judgment for choosing to miss a class. 

<p>

Except for exam days, excuses for absences are not required. Absence
from an exam may be excused, at the discretion of the instructor, for
certain events planned in advance or for emergency or illness. Here is
the procedure to follow if you wish to have an exam absence excused.
<ul>
<li>Send the instructor email notice of your exam absence as far as
  possible in advance of the missed exam, with a complete
  explanation for the purpose of your conflicting event.
    <li>In the case of illness or emergency where advance notice
      is not possible, send an email message as soon as it is practically possible. Collect
      documentation (doctor's notes, etc) to present to the instructor
      when you return to class. Except for extreme circumstances, your
      email notice is due by 5pm on the
      day of the missed exam.
</ul>

<p>

Absence does not change the due date for any graded work. 
<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/class_engagement.html"-->
<h3><a name="Class Engagement">4.2</a> Class Engagement</h3>
  
The purpose of class meetings is to pursue understanding and mastery of
the course material. This requires mental presence, engagement with the
subject, and participation. Class meetings presume respect, politeness,
and kindness among all those in attendance. In consideration for the
learning environment, please observe the following in the classroom.

<ul>
<li>No food during class (in class or online attendance).
<li>Use electronic devices only for engaging with the course
  material. For example, note-taking, calculating, and looking up facts
  related to the class discussion are positive activities; text
  messaging and web surfing are rude behaviors that distract everyone
  from focusing.
  <li>Except for emergencies, please do not leave the class meeting once class
  begins. If you need to leave before the end of class, please inform
  the instructor before class begins.
</ul>


<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/collaboration.html"-->
<h3><a name="Collaboration versus Plagiarism">4.3</a> Collaboration versus Plagiarism</h3>

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and ask questions of the
instructor or consult any source for homework and out-of-class writing
exercises.  You must work hard to avoid plagiarism, which is presenting someone
else's ideas or work as your own.  <b>The work you submit must be your own.</b> Your
writing must be your own voice and your own understanding.  You must use proper
academic citation for any material created by others.  Plagiarism is a serious
academic offense; penalties range from failing the course to expulsion from the
college.
<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/honor_policy.html"-->
<h3><a name="Honor Policy">4.4</a> Honor Policy</h3>

It is expected that each student in this class will act with honesty and 
academic integrity.  Instances of academic dishonesty will be pursued as
described in the College Catalog and Student Handbook.

<h2><a name="Learning and Study">5</a> Learning and Study</h2>

<!--@include "../../study/study_strategies.html"-->
<h3><a name="Learning">5.1</a> Learning</h3>

Learning through study outside of class is the most important part of the course.
The process of reading, thinking, solving problems, and writing
is the only way to achieve real understanding and skills. No one else
can read, think, or write for you. It can be very helpful to watch other
people solve problems and explain ideas in class, in a video, in a study
group, or in a tutoring session, but that is no substitute for study
that you do yourself.

<p>

The time expectation for out-of-class study is two hours outside of class for
every hour of class meeting time. Plan your study time in your weekly
schedule. 

<p>

The quality of your out-of-class study translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little time spent studying guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality studying guarantees a positive learning
experience. Here is an outline of the studying process.

<p>

  <ul>
  <li><b>BEFORE each class meeting</b>
  <ul>
	<li><b>Read</b> the text section(s) indicated on
	  the course calendar.
	  <li><b>Write</b> vocabulary and facts from the new text
	    section. Make vocabulary study cards.
	    <li><b>Solve</b> at least a few of the low numbered problems
	      from the new text section.
	      <li><b>Note</b> your questions, problems, and
	      difficulties. In the reading, where, precisely, do you
	      have trouble understanding? With the problems, what,
		precisely, is obstructing you from completing a
		solution?
  </ul>
    <li><b>AFTER each class meeting</b>
  <ul>
		<li><b>Reread</b> text sections listed for previous
		  class meetings.
		  <li><b>Solve more</b> problems. Complete the list of
		  homework problems from text sections for previous
		    class days. Prepare complete written solutions,
		  using complete sentences.
		    <li><b>Revise</b> and update your vocabulary and
		    fact note cards after a second round with
		      each section of text.
  </ul>
    <li><b>EVERY WEEK</b>
  <ul>		      
		      <li><b>Assess</b> your progress and mastery. Have
		      you addressed all the questions and difficulties
			noted previously?
			<li><b>Follow up</b> on any questions or gaps
			that remain.
  </ul>
  </ul>


<h3><a name="Study Strategies">5.2</a> Study Strategies</h3>

<ul>
<li>Plan for two hours of study outside of class for each hour of class.
<li>Keep an organized paper binder or electronic notebook with reading notes, homework solutions, and
  class notes. Mark your questions clearly with sticky notes or some
  other device and follow up every question, either in class
  or in office hours, until you gain understanding.
<li>After reading, summarize the material in your own words.
<li>Use flash cards or lists to learn
  vocabulary. Write each term on one side of a card. Write a definition
  (using complete sentences, not sentence fragments) and an example on
  the back of the card.
<li>To prepare for quizzes and exams, do the following, beginning some
  days to a week in advance.
<ul>
<li>Make an outline of course topics and problem types.
<li>Memorize vocabulary, including examples.
<li>Work and check solutions to problems from previous quizzes, exams,
  and homework.
</ul>
<li>If clock management during exams is an issue, practice working a few
  exam style problems once a week with a timer running.
<li>If test anxiety has a negative effect on your performance, here
  is <a href="http://www.studygs.net/tstprp8.htm">some advice</a>.
    <li>Do not become sleep deprived. Trading sleep for study time is
      counterproductive.
      <li>Eat a healthy diet and exercise every day. Eating poorly and
      lack of physical activity reduce your mental abilities.
</ul>
