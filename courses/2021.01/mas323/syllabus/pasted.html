<h3>Course Goals, Objectives, and Learning Outcomes</h3>

The primary goal of the course is <b>mathematical intellectual
growth</b> through the <b>understanding and mastery of mathematical
concepts</b>. Student learning objectives are strength and fluency
in <b>reading</b>, in <b>analysis and problem solving</b>, and
in <b>clear, concise communication</b>. Achievement of goals and
learning objectives requires desire for learning, willingness to work
hard, time commitment (at least two hours on homework outside of class
for each hour in class), and persistence.

<p>
  
<b>Learning Outcomes Summary</b>. Through the medium of the mathematical concepts of this
course, a student who achieves the course learning objectives will:
<ul>
<li>have increased strength and fluency in reading skills
<li>have increased strength and fluency in analysis and problem solving skills
<li>have increased strength and fluency in clear, concise communication skills
</ul>

<h2>Grades</h2>

<!--@include "graded_work_3XX.html"-->
<h3>Graded Work</h3>

Your cumulative average is determined by graded work in the categories listed
below with the indicated weights. Details and instructions are given in
the sections that follow.

<pre>
  Daily Participation    10%
  Problem Sets           35%
  Exams (non-final)      30%
  Final exam             25%
</pre>



<h3>Daily Participation</h3>

Daily participation consists of presenting solutions to problems and
particiating in discussion of presentations made by other students and
the instructor. Presentations will be
graded for effort and completeness, but not for correctness. Here is the
grading rubric.

<p>

  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Daily presentations</th>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Category</b></th>
    <th> Description</b></th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> Complete</td>
    <td> Presentations are fully prepared in a
      way that shows a good faith effort to thoroughly complete the assignment.
    </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> Partially complete</td>
    <td> Presentations are not fully complete or show
    little effort to thoroughly complete the assignment. </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> No credit</td>
    <td> Presentations are not prepared. </td>
    </td>
</tr>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/exam_grading_1XX.html"-->
<h3>Exams</h3>  

Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. In keeping with College
policy, the final exam can only be taken at the officially scheduled
time during final exams week.

<p>

<!--  
No music players or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during quizzes or exams. If you need to leave the
classroom during an exam, you must leave your cell phone at the
instructor's desk in the front of the room.

<p>
  -->
  
For full credit, quiz and exam solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work and using
appropriate vocabulary that you understand the reasoning involved. Each
solution requires one or more complete sentences.  Solutions will be
graded not only for mathematical correctness, but for clarity of
writing.  Illegible work or a final answer given without supporting work
shown receives no credit.

<p>
  
Exam problem solutions will be graded
using the following rubric. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.

<p>
  
  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Exam Grading Rubric</th>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Category</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>Complete and Correct</td>
    <td> Solution is complete and correct, shows appropriate work, and uses appropriate
    vocabulary. </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>Nearly complete and correct</td>
    <td> Solution has a small flaw (for example, there's a correct solution method,
    but an arithmetic error throws off the final answer, or an important
    term is missing that should have been mentioned). Solution
    shows understanding of method(s) and issues involved.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>Some progress</td>
    <td> There is some attempt at the problem; there is plausible
    evidence that some aspect of
    the problem is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>No progress</td>
    <td> The response is blank, illegible, or shows
    no plausible evidence that some key aspect of the solution is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

<h3>Gradebook</h3>

instructor. The grade record in Canvas is not complete and does not
calculate your cumulative average.

<h3>Makeup Assignments, Makeup Exams, and Extra Credit</h3>

There are no makeup assignments, makeup exams, or extra credit
assignments.

<h2>Policies</h2>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/attendance.html"-->
<h3>Attendance</h3>

Class attendance is expected, but it is understood that sometimes there
are reasonable circumstances for absence. There is no
grade for attendance or participation, but it is expected that each
student will exercise good judgment for choosing to miss a class. 

<p>

Except for exam days, excuses for absences are not required. Absence
from an exam may be excused, at the discretion of the instructor, for
certain events planned in advance or for emergency or illness. Here is
the procedure to follow if you wish to have an exam absence excused.
<ul>
<li>Send the instructor email notice of your exam absence as far as
  possible in advance of the missed exam, with a complete
  explanation for the purpose of your conflicting event.
    <li>In the case of illness or emergency where advance notice
      is not possible, send an email message as soon as it is practically possible. Collect
      documentation (doctor's notes, etc) to present to the instructor
      when you return to class. Except for extreme circumstances, your
      email notice is due by 5pm on the
      day of the missed exam.
</ul>

<p>

Absence does not change the due date for any graded work. 
<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/class_engagement.html"-->
<h3>Class Engagement</h3>
  
The purpose of class meetings is to pursue understanding and mastery of
the course material. This requires mental presence, engagement with the
subject, and participation. Class meetings presume respect, politeness,
and kindness among all those in attendance. In consideration for the
learning environment, please observe the following in the classroom.

<ul>
<li>No food during class (in class or online attendance).
<li>Use electronic devices only for engaging with the course
  material. For example, note-taking, calculating, and looking up facts
  related to the class discussion are positive activities; text
  messaging and web surfing are rude behaviors that distract everyone
  from focusing.
  <li>Except for emergencies, please do not leave the class meeting once class
  begins. If you need to leave before the end of class, please inform
  the instructor before class begins.
</ul>


<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/collaboration.html"-->
<h3>Collaboration versus Plagiarism</h3>

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and ask questions of the
instructor or consult any source for homework and out-of-class writing
exercises.  You must work hard to avoid plagiarism, which is presenting someone
else's ideas or work as your own.  <b>The work you submit must be your own.</b> Your
writing must be your own voice and your own understanding.  You must use proper
academic citation for any material created by others.  Plagiarism is a serious
academic offense; penalties range from failing the course to expulsion from the
college.
<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/honor_policy.html"-->
<h3>Honor Policy</h3>

It is expected that each student in this class will act with honesty and 
academic integrity.  Instances of academic dishonesty will be pursued as
described in the College Catalog and Student Handbook.
