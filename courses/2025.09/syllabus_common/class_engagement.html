<h3>Class Engagement</h3>
  
The purpose of class meetings is to pursue understanding and proficiency
with the course material. This requires mental presence, engagement with
the subject, and participation. Class meetings presume respect,
politeness, and kindness among all those in attendance. In consideration
for the learning environment, please observe the following.

<ul>
<!--  <li>Online attendees must have video on.-->
<li>No food is allowed during class.
  <li>Phones, laptop computers, and tablet devices are allowed, but only for accessing the course
    text(s) and for taking notes.
    <li>To discourage bad habits, use of electronic devices is allowed only in seats
    where the instructor can pass freely behind your seat and see
      your screen(s) with an unobstructed view.
  <li>Except for emergencies, please do not leave the class meeting once class
  begins. If you need to leave before the end of class, please inform
  the instructor before class begins.
</ul>
