<h3>Attendance</h3>

Class attendance is expected, but it is understood that sometimes there
are reasonable circumstances for absence ("absence" refers to missing
some or all of a class meeting---this includes arriving late or leaving early). Absence
from class may be excused, at the discretion of the instructor, for
certain events planned in advance or for emergency, illness, or
circumstance beyond your control. Here is the procedure to follow if you
wish to have an absence excused.
<ul>
<li>Send the instructor email notice of your absence as far as
  possible in advance, with a complete
  explanation for the purpose of your conflicting event.
    <li>In the case of illness, emergency, or other circumstance where
      advance notice is not possible, speak to the instructor or send an
      email message as soon as it is practically possible. Except for
      extreme circumstances, your notice is due by 5pm on the day of the
      absence. Collect documentation (doctor's notes, etc) and send them
      to the instructor by email.
</ul>

<p>

You will receive a grade of "Excused" for any assignment that you miss
due to an excused absence. An "Excused" grade does not
count for you or against you in your cumulative average. You will
receive a grade of zero for any assignment that you miss on a day when
you have an absence that is not excused.
