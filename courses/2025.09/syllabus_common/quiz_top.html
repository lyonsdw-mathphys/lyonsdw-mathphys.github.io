<h3>Quizzes and Exams</h3>  

Quiz and exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned reading and
exercises. For each quiz or exam, the format and subject matter will be
announced in advance. 

<p>

  <!-- FALL 2025 specific announcement here -->

  The only difference between quizzes and exams is that quizzes are
  shorter and more frequent, and exams are longer and less frequent. For
  fall semester 2025, MAS 161 and MAS 261 will have quizzes about once
  each week. MAS 311 will have exams every few weeks.

<p>
  The final exam period may be used for one last quiz or exam. Part of
  the final exam period quiz or exam may be cumulative (that is, cover material from the entire semester). The final exam
  period will also be used for any needed makeup quizzes or exams;
  see the <a href="#make_up">"Makeup Assignments"</a> policy below. Whether and how
  the final exam period will be used will be announced near the end of
  the semester.
