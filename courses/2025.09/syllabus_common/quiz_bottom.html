  <h4>Quizzes/Exams: Grading</h4>

For full credit, quiz/exam solutions must show not just final results, but
also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work and using appropriate
vocabulary that you understand the reasoning involved. Some solutions
(marked by the label "<b>DISCUSSION</b>") must be written in narrative
form, using one or more complete sentences.  Solutions will be graded
not only for mathematical correctness, but for clarity of writing.
Illegible work or a final answer given without supporting work shown
receives no credit.

  <p>
  
Here is the grading rubric for solutions to quiz/exam problems.
