<h2><a name="Learning and Study"></a> Learning and Study</h2>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/learning.html"-->
<a name="Learning"></a>
<h3><a name="Learning">7</a> Learning</h3>

The process of reading, learning vocabulary, solving problems, and writing
is the only way to achieve real understanding and skills. No one else
can read, think, or write for you. It can be very helpful to watch other
people solve problems and explain ideas in class, in a video, in a study
group, or in a tutoring session, but there is no substitute for study
that you do yourself.

<p>

The time expectation for out-of-class work is two hours outside of class for
every one hour of class meeting time. Plan your study time in your weekly
schedule. 

<p>

The quality of your out-of-class study translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little study time guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality studying guarantees a positive learning
experience. Here is an outline of the work flow for each section in the text(s).

<p>

  <ul>
  <li><b>BEFORE class.</b> Read the text material indicated on the
	  course calendar. Write solutions to problems
	  (see the <a href="#reading_and_exercises">"Reading and
	  Exercises"</a> list above) and submit them to Canvas. Note your questions, problems, and
	  difficulties. In the reading, where, precisely, do you have
	  trouble understanding? With the problems, what, precisely, is
	  obstructing you from completing a solution?
    <li><b>AFTER class.</b>  Review text material from previous class
		meetings. Make vocabulary study cards (or study lists)
		for terminology, facts, and formulas; make sure your
		study card list is complete.  Solve and check solutions
		to all of the remaining problems in the "Reading and
		Exercises" list above.
    <li><b>BEFORE each quiz/exam.</b>  Assess your progress and
	proficiency. Have you addressed all the questions and
	difficulties noted previously?  Rehearse vocabulary using the
	cards or lists you have prepared.  Practice solving problems
	using a timer.  Follow up on any questions or gaps that remain.
    <li><b>AFTER each quiz/exam.</b>  Assess (again!) your progress and
		      proficiency. Rework and check solutions to all
		      quiz problems for which you received less than
		      full credit.  Follow up (again!) on any questions
		      or gaps that remain.
  </ul>


<h3><a name="Study Strategies">8</a> Study Strategies</h3>

<ul>
<li>Plan for two hours of study outside of class for each hour of class.
<li>Keep an organized paper binder or electronic notebook with reading notes, homework solutions, and
  class notes (see the <a href="#Portfolio">Portfolio</a> section
  below). Mark your questions clearly with sticky notes or some 
  other device and follow up every question, either in class
  or in office hours, until you gain understanding.
<li>After reading, summarize the material in your own words.
<li>Use flash cards or lists to learn
  vocabulary. Write each term on one side of a card. Write a definition
  (using complete sentences, not sentence fragments) and an example on
  the back of the card.
<li>To prepare for quizzes and exams, do the following, beginning some
  days to a week in advance.
<ul>
<li>Make an outline of course topics and problem types.
<li>Memorize vocabulary, including examples.
<li>Work and check solutions to problems from previous quizzes, exams,
  and homework.
</ul>
<li>If clock management during quizzes/exams is an issue, practice working a few
  quiz/exam style problems once a week with a timer running.
<li>If test anxiety has a negative effect on your performance, here
  is <a href="http://www.studygs.net/tstprp8.htm">some advice</a>.
    <li>Do not become sleep deprived. Trading sleep for study time is
      counterproductive.
      <li>Eat a healthy diet and exercise every day. Eating poorly and
      lack of physical activity reduce your mental abilities.
</ul>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/portfolio.html"-->
<a name="Portfolio"></a>
<h3><a name="Portfolio">9</a> Portfolio</h3>

Keep your work organized. Use electronic or hard copy media, whatever
works best for you. Whatever method you use, it should be designed to
facilitate sorting, searching, planning, and tracking. A complete
portfolio includes:
<ul>
  <li>Progress tracking sheet(s) (make a copy of
  the <a href="#reading_and_exercises">Reading and Exercises</a> list that you can use for checking off the work you have completed)
  <li>Vocabulary notecards or study sheets (here
  are  <a href="../../syllabus_common/sample_notecards1.pdf">example notecards</a>)
  <li>Reading and class notes
  <li>Solved exercises
</ul>
Your portfolio is an essential tool for learning; it is also an essential
instrument for diagnosis and improvement. Bring your portfolio to class
meetings and to office hours.

<h3><a name="Graded Exercises">11</a> Graded Exercises</h3>

Reading the text(s) and solving problems is the largest part of your
work in this course, and most of it takes place outside of class. To
show evidence of your progress, you will submit solutions to "pre-class
exercises" (see the <a href="#reading_and_exercises">Reading and
Exercises</a> section above) online on Canvas. Your work may be typed or
written by hand. Your work must be submitted as a single pdf file,
whether it is handwritten or typed (pdf scanning is a built-in utility
for iphones and android phones).  Work is not accepted late. There are
no makeup assignments.

<p>

Solutions will be graded for preparation and completeness, not for
correctness. For full credit, all solutions must show evidence that you
have read the material and must show evidence of your thinking and
understanding.  You are not expected to solve all of the problems
perfectly, but you are expected to try.

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/participation.html"-->
<a name="class_participation"></a>
<h3><a name="Class Participation">12</a> Class Participation</h3>

There are two ways that class participation counts towards your
grade. One is attendance (see the <a href="#attendance">"Attendance"
  section</a>) and the other is in-class presentations of solutions to problems.
<!--The rotation schedule for presentations and which problems you will
    present will be announced in advance.-->
Presentations will be graded for effort and
completeness, but not for correctness. 

<p>

Full credit for participation is based on being present and engaged in
class meetings. The participation grade is lowered by unexcused absence(s)
(this includes unexcused late arrival(s)) and under-prepared presentation(s).

<h3><a name="Quizzes and Exams">13</a> Quizzes and Exams</h3>

Quiz and exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned reading and
exercises. For each quiz or exam, the format and subject matter will be
announced in advance. 

<p>

  <!-- FALL 2025 specific announcement here -->

  The only difference between quizzes and exams is that quizzes are
  shorter and more frequent, and exams are longer and less frequent. For
  fall semester 2025, MAS 161 and MAS 261 will have quizzes about once
  each week. MAS 311 will have exams every few weeks.

<p>
  The final exam period may be used for one last quiz or exam. Part of
  the final exam period quiz or exam may be cumulative (that is, cover material from the entire semester). The final exam
  period will also be used for any needed makeup quizzes or exams;
  see the <a href="#make_up">"Makeup Assignments"</a> policy below. Whether and how
  the final exam period will be used will be announced near the end of
  the semester.
  
<p>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/letter_grades.html"-->
<a name="LetterGrades"></a>
<h3><a name="Letter Grades">15</a> Letter Grades</h3>

<h4>Meaning of letter grades</h4>

According to the College Catalog, letter grades have the following
meanings.

<pre>
   Letter Grade     Meaning
   ------------     ------
        A           excellent
        B           good
        C           satisfactory
        D           requirements and standards met at a minimum level
        F           course requirements not met
</pre>

Standards for "excellent" and "good" (letter grades A and B) are high.
In this course, your grade reflects your proficiency with the material.  A good
grade is not guaranteed by class attendance and performing the motions of
homework; to earn an A or a B, you must demonstrate understanding that
transcends mere rote familiarity.

<h4>Determination of letter grade</h4>

At the end of the semester, your cumulative course average is used to
assign a letter grade. The scale used to convert cumulative averages to
letter grades is based on the "standard 10 point scale" (A-,A for the 
90 to 100 percent range, B-,B,B+ for percentages in the 80's, C-,C,C+
for the 70's, etc.), but the scale may be adjusted, at the discretion of
the instructor, so that the meanings of the letter grades fit the
descriptions given in the previous section. Pluses and minuses are used
to distinguish between the low, middle and high achievers within each
letter grade category.

<p>
<i>Note on mid-term grades:</i> Pluses and minuses are not used for

<h3><a name="Attendance">16</a> Attendance</h3>

Class attendance is expected, but it is understood that sometimes there
are reasonable circumstances for absence ("absence" refers to missing
some or all of a class meeting---this includes arriving late or leaving early). Absence
from class may be excused, at the discretion of the instructor, for
certain events planned in advance or for emergency, illness, or
circumstance beyond your control. Here is the procedure to follow if you
wish to have an absence excused.
<ul>
<li>Send the instructor email notice of your absence as far as
  possible in advance, with a complete
  explanation for the purpose of your conflicting event.
    <li>In the case of illness, emergency, or other circumstance where
      advance notice is not possible, speak to the instructor or send an
      email message as soon as it is practically possible. Except for
      extreme circumstances, your notice is due by 5pm on the day of the
      absence. Collect documentation (doctor's notes, etc) and send them
      to the instructor by email.
</ul>

<p>

You will receive a grade of "Excused" for any assignment that you miss
due to an excused absence. An "Excused" grade does not
count for you or against you in your cumulative average. You will
receive a grade of zero for any assignment that you miss on a day when
you have an absence that is not excused.

<h3><a name="Class Engagement">17</a> Class Engagement</h3>
  
The purpose of class meetings is to pursue understanding and proficiency
with the course material. This requires mental presence, engagement with
the subject, and participation. Class meetings presume respect,
politeness, and kindness among all those in attendance. In consideration
for the learning environment, please observe the following.

<ul>
<!--  <li>Online attendees must have video on.-->
<li>No food is allowed during class.
  <li>Phones, laptop computers, and tablet devices are allowed, but only for accessing the course
    text(s) and for taking notes.
    <li>To discourage bad habits, use of electronic devices is allowed only in seats
    where the instructor can pass freely behind your seat and see
      your screen(s) with an unobstructed view.
  <li>Except for emergencies, please do not leave the class meeting once class
  begins. If you need to leave before the end of class, please inform
  the instructor before class begins.
</ul>

<h3><a name="Collaboration versus Plagiarism">18</a> Collaboration versus Plagiarism</h3>

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and ask questions of
the instructor or consult any source for homework. You must work hard to
avoid plagiarism, which is presenting someone else's ideas or work as
your own.  <b>The work you submit must be your own.</b> Your writing
must be your own voice and your own understanding.  You must use proper
academic citation for any material created by others.  Plagiarism is a
serious academic offense; penalties range from failing the course to
expulsion from the college.

<p>

In the event of a canceled class, work on your portfolio (see the
<a href="#Portfolio">Portfolio</a> Section). Making your portfolio more complete, more
  thorough, and more clear is the best possible thing you can do to
  replace missed class meeting time. This extra portfolio work will count in the category "Blogs and
  Journals" in the "Equivalent Instructional Activities" document on the
<a href="https://lvc4.sharepoint.com/sites/FacultyandStaff/SitePages/Equivalent-Instructional-Activities.aspx">
  web pages </a> of the LVC Registrar.
