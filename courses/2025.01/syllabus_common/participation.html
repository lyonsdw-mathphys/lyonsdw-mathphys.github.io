<h3>Class Participation</h3>

There are two ways that class participation counts towards your
grade. One is attendance (see the <a href="#attendance">"Attendance"
  section</a>) and the other is in-class presentations of solutions to problems.
<!--The rotation schedule for presentations and which problems you will
    present will be announced in advance.-->
Presentations will be graded for effort and
completeness, but not for correctness. 

<p>

Full credit for participation is based on being present and engaged in
class meetings. The participation grade is lowered by unexcused absence(s)
(this includes unexcused late arrival(s)) and under-prepared presentation(s).
