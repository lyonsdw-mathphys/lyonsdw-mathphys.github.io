<h3>Graded Reading and Exercises</h3>

Reading the text(s) and solving problems (see
the <a name="reading_and_exercises">Reading and Exercises</a> section
above) is the largest part of your work in this course, and most of it
takes place outside of class. To show evidence of your progress, you
will submit solutions to exercises online on Canvas. Your work may be typed or
written by hand. Your work must be submitted as a single pdf file,
whether it is handwritten or typed (pdf scanning is a built-in utility
for iphones and android phones).  Work is not accepted late. There are
no makeup assignments.

<p>

Solutions will be graded for preparation and completeness, not for
correctness. For full credit, all solutions must show evidence that you
have read the material and must show evidence of your thinking and
understanding.  You are not expected to solve all of the problems
perfectly, but you are expected to try.
