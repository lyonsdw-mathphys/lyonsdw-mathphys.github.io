<h3>Graded Reading and Exercises</h3>

You are not expected to solve all of the Graded Exercises
perfectly, but you are expected to try. Graded Exercises will be graded
for preparation and completeness, not for correctness. For full credit,
all solutions must show evidence that you have read the material and
must show evidence of your thinking and understanding.

<p>

Submit Graded Exercises online on Canvas.  Your work may be typed or
written by hand. Your work must be submitted as a single pdf file,
whether it is handwritten or typed (pdf scanning is a built-in utility
for iphones and android phones).  Work is not accepted late. There are
no makeup assignments.
