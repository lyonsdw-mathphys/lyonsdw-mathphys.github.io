<h3>Quizzes</h3>  

We will have a quiz at the beginning of class one day each week.
Quiz problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned reading and
exercises. For each quiz, the format and subject matter will be
announced in advance.

  The final exam period may be used for one last quiz. The final exam
  period will also be used for any needed makeup quizzes;
  see the <a href="#make_up">"Makeup Assignments"</a> policy below. Whether and how
  the final exam period will be used will be announced near the end of
  the semester.
