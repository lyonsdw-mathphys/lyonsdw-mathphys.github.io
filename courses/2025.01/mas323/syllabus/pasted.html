<h2>Learning and Study</h2>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/learning.html"-->
<a name="Learning"></a>
<h3>Learning</h3>

The process of reading, learning vocabulary, solving problems, and writing
is the only way to achieve real understanding and skills. No one else
can read, think, or write for you. It can be very helpful to watch other
people solve problems and explain ideas in class, in a video, in a study
group, or in a tutoring session, but there is no substitute for study
that you do yourself.

<p>

The time expectation for out-of-class work is two hours outside of class for
every one hour of class meeting time. Plan your study time in your weekly
schedule. 

<p>

The quality of your out-of-class study translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little study time guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality studying guarantees a positive learning
experience. Here is an outline of the work flow for each section in the text(s).

<p>

  <ul>
  <li><b>BEFORE class.</b> Read the text material indicated on the
	  course calendar. Write solutions to Graded Exercises
	  (see the <a href="#reading_and_exercises">"Reading and
	  Exercises"</a> list above) and submit them to Canvas. Note your questions, problems, and
	  difficulties. In the reading, where, precisely, do you have
	  trouble understanding? With the problems, what, precisely, is
	  obstructing you from completing a solution?
    <li><b>AFTER class.</b>  Review text material from previous class
		meetings. Make vocabulary study cards (or study lists)
		for terminology, facts, and formulas; make sure your
		study card list is complete.  Solve and check solutions
		to all of the remaining problems in the "Reading and
		Exercises" list above.
    <li><b>BEFORE each quiz.</b>  Assess your progress and
	proficiency. Have you addressed all the questions and
	difficulties noted previously?  Rehearse vocabulary using the
	cards or lists you have prepared.  Practice solving problems
	using a timer.  Follow up on any questions or gaps that remain.
    <li><b>AFTER each quiz.</b>  Assess (again!) your progress and
		      proficiency. Rework and check solutions to all
		      quiz problems for which you received less than
		      full credit.  Follow up (again!) on any questions
		      or gaps that remain.
  </ul>


<h3>Study Strategies</h3>

<ul>
<li>Plan for two hours of study outside of class for each hour of class.
<li>Keep an organized paper binder or electronic notebook with reading notes, homework solutions, and
  class notes (see the <a href="#Portfolio">Portfolio</a> section
  below). Mark your questions clearly with sticky notes or some 
  other device and follow up every question, either in class
  or in office hours, until you gain understanding.
<li>After reading, summarize the material in your own words.
<li>Use flash cards or lists to learn
  vocabulary. Write each term on one side of a card. Write a definition
  (using complete sentences, not sentence fragments) and an example on
  the back of the card.
<li>To prepare for quizzes and exams, do the following, beginning some
  days to a week in advance.
<ul>
<li>Make an outline of course topics and problem types.
<li>Memorize vocabulary, including examples.
<li>Work and check solutions to problems from previous quizzes, exams,
  and homework.
</ul>
<li>If clock management during exams is an issue, practice working a few
  exam style problems once a week with a timer running.
<li>If test anxiety has a negative effect on your performance, here
  is <a href="http://www.studygs.net/tstprp8.htm">some advice</a>.
    <li>Do not become sleep deprived. Trading sleep for study time is
      counterproductive.
      <li>Eat a healthy diet and exercise every day. Eating poorly and
      lack of physical activity reduce your mental abilities.
</ul>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/portfolio.html"-->
<a name="Portfolio"></a>
<h3>Portfolio</h3>

Keep your work organized. Use electronic or hard copy media, whatever
works best for you. Whatever method you use, it should be designed to
facilitate sorting, searching, planning, and tracking. A complete
portfolio includes:
<ul>
  <li>Progress tracking sheet(s) (make a copy of
  the <a href="#reading_and_exercises">Reading and Exercises</a> list that you can use for checking off the work you have completed)
  <li>Vocabulary notecards or study sheets (here
  are  <a href="../../syllabus_common/sample_notecards1.pdf">example notecards</a>)
  <li>Reading and class notes
  <li>Solved exercises
</ul>
Your portfolio is an essential tool for learning; it is also an essential
instrument for diagnosis and improvement. Bring your portfolio to class
meetings and to office hours.


<h2>Graded Work</h2>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/graded_work_intro.html"-->
<a name="graded_work_components"></a>
<h3>Grade Components</h3>

Your cumulative average is determined by graded work in the categories
listed below with the indicated weights. Due dates are shown on
Canvas. Details and instructions are given in the sections that follow.

<!--@include "grade_categories.html"-->
<pre>
  Graded Exercises       10%
  Daily Participation    10%
  Written Assignments    20%
  Quizzes                60%
</pre>



<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/graded_exercises.html"-->
<h3>Graded Exercises</h3>

Graded Exercises (see the <a href="#reading_and_exercises">"Reading and Exercises"</a> list
above) are chosen to help understand the material in the
reading. You are not expected to solve all of the Graded Exercises
perfectly, but you are expected to try. Graded Exercises will be graded
for preparation and completeness, not for correctness. For full credit,
all solutions must show evidence that you have read the material and
must show evidence of your thinking and understanding.

<p>

Submit Graded Exercises online on Canvas.  Your work may be typed or
written by hand. Your work must be submitted as a single pdf file,
whether it is handwritten or typed (pdf scanning is a built-in utility
for iphones and android phones).  Work is not accepted late. There are
no makeup assignments.

<h3>Class Participation</h3>

There are two ways that class participation counts towards your
grade. One is attendance (see the <a href="#attendance">"Attendance"
  section</a>) and the other is in-class presentations of solutions to problems.
The rotation schedule for presentations and which problems you will
present will be announced in advance. Presentations will be graded for effort and
completeness, but not for correctness. Here is the presentation grading rubric.

<h3>Writing Assignments</h3>  

Writing assignments must be typed and must use appropriate mathematical
symbols and typesetting conventions. Handwritten solutions will not be
accepted. Your writing assignment will be graded for correctness in the
following ways: for correct use of vocabulary and notation; for correct
logical flow in your argument; and for the correct final
conclusion(s).

<p>
<b>Audience and sources.</b> Write for a reader who is a fellow student
in this class. You may assume that the reader is familiar with all of
the definitions and facts stated in the course text(s), so you do not
have to repeat them in your writing. If you use any new definitions that
do not come from the course text(s), then you need to state them in your
writing. If you cite facts that are not stated in the course text(s),
then you need to state them and prove them yourself in your
writing. Otherwise, your proof can
only use facts that are established in the course text(s).

<p>
  <b>Acknowledgments.</b> If you consult with anyone besides the
  instructor, or if you use any source besides the course textbook in
  the process of developing your solution or helping with your writing,
  it is proper academic form to acknowledge these people and sources at the end of your
  writing assignment.
  
<p>

The grading rubric for each written solution is the same
as for the <a href="#quizexam_grading_rubric">"Quiz/Exam Grading
Rubric"</a>, with the addition of the following in the description for
all four rows except "No Progress".

<blockquote>
  The written solution is typed and uses appropriate mathematical
    symbols and typesetting conventions.
</blockquote>
