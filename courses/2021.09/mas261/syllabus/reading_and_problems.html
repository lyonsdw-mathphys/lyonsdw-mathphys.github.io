<h3>Reading and Problem List</h3>

Read the text sections listed below. In [Calc3], work all of the
Checkpoint problems, and work every other odd numbered problem in the
Exercises at the end of each section. If additional practice is needed,
work more odd numbered Exercises. All exercises that require
3D graphing software are optional. In [LinAlg], work all of the
problems.
