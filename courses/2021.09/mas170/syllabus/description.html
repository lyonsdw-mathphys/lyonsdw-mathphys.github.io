<h3>Course Description</h3>

This course is an introduction to elementary descriptive and inferential
statistics. We emphasize qualitative understanding and judgment in the use of
statistics, addressing questions such as when conclusions based on statistics
are justified or meaningful. Topics may include design of experiments,
descriptive statistics, correlation and regression, probability, sampling and
hypothesis testing.
