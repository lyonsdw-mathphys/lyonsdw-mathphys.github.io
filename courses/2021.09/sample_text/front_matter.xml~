        <title>Preface</title>

<p>The central concept of differential calculus is that of the <i>local
    linearization</i>. Most introductory multivariable calculus texts define
and utilize vectors and vector operations, but stop short of defining
  <i>linear transformations</i>. The purpose of these notes is to fill that
gap. By developing the basic properties and vocabulary of linear
transformations and the corresponding matrix algebra, the aim is to
provide a natural, unifying, and useful language for understanding the
definition of the derivative and facts including the chain rule.
</p>

<p>The material in these notes is not meant to be a short version of a full
semester linear algebra course. It is designed to provide enough basic
linear algebra and matrix algebra to work effectively with the material
in a standard introductory multivariable calculus course.
</p>

<p>A secondary purpose of these notes is to address the common practice in
undergraduate textbooks (even in courses on linear algebra!) of
introducing matrix multiplication as a "voodoo" practice, that is, a
complicated operation on boxes of numbers given without
motivation. Here, we develop matrix multiplication as the natural
consequence of the fact that matrices represent linear transformations:
the product of matrices that represent two linear transformations is the
matrix that represents their composition. For this development alone,
the first three sections of these notes could be of use in a linear
algebra course.
</p>

 <p>Here is an example of a possible schedule for integrating these
   notes into a multivariate calculus course in a total of 3 to 5
   50-minute class meetings.
   <ul>
     <li>Sections 1,2,3: Add two or three days to the end of the multivariate
       calculus text's chapter on vectors in <m>\R^2</m> and <m>\R^3</m>
       (material on dot products and cross products, etc)
     </li>
     <li>Section 4: Add one or two days at the end of the multivariate
     calculus text's chapter on partial derivatives (material on
     tangent planes, chain rule, etc)</li>
   </ul>
 </p>

     <p>Instructor's solutions are intended for the instructor
     only. Please do not give copies of instructor's solutions to
     students. Student's learn by constructing their own derivations,
     explanations, and proofs. Student access to complete solutions
     undermines the goals of the course.
