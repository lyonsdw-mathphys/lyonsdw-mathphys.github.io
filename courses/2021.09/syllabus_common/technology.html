<h3>Required Technology</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Submissions for graded homework and exams: any device that can
      produce a single pdf file from scans or photos of multiple pages
      of handwritten work (scan-to-pdf capability is a built-in feature of Android and
      Apple phones; there are also many free apps)
    <li>Online class attendance and office hours (if Zoom class meetings
      and office hours become necessary): any device with a webcam and
      microphone and running Zoom
<li>Webcam for exams (if Zoom class meetings and office hours become
  necessary): you will need to have a webcam ON (but microphone off) in
  a Zoom meeting during exams
</ul>

<!--
It is <b>strongly recommended</b> to have a Windows or Mac laptop
computer with a good webcam and microphone, but not strictly
required. If you don't have a Windows or Mac computer with a webcam and
microphone, you will have to make your own arrangements to borrow one,
or pay to use a professional testing service on site, if we have to
switch to Lockdown Browser for exams. Chromebook and Linux laptops may
not be able to run Lockdown Browser.
