<!--
It is <b>strongly recommended</b> to have a Windows or Mac laptop
computer with a good webcam and microphone, but not strictly
required. If you don't have a Windows or Mac computer with a webcam and
microphone, you will have to make your own arrangements to borrow one,
or pay to use a professional testing service on site, if we have to
switch to Lockdown Browser for exams. Chromebook and Linux laptops may
not be able to run Lockdown Browser.
