<h3>Course Goals, Objectives, and Learning Outcomes</h3>

The primary goal of the course is <b>understanding and proficiency</b>
  in the use of mathematical concepts. Student learning objectives are
  proficiency in <b>reading</b>, <b>analysis and problem solving</b>,
  and <b>clear, concise communication</b>. Achievement of goals and
  objectives requires desire for learning, willingness to work hard,
  time commitment (two hours outside of class for every one hour in
  class), and persistence.

<p>
  
<b>Learning Outcomes Summary</b>. Understanding and using the mathematical
concepts of this course, a student who achieves the course learning objectives will:
<ul>
<li>demonstrate proficiency in reading skills
<li>demonstrate proficiency in analysis and problem solving skills
<li>demonstrate proficiency in clear, concise communication skills
</ul>

<h3>Required Technology</h3>

<ul>
    <li>PDF scanner app for your phone (or other device) for scanning
      your work on one or more pages into single pdf file. Scan-to-pdf capability
      is a built-in feature of Android and Apple phones; there are also
      many free apps
    <li>Canvas app for your phone (or other device) for submitting
    your work
</ul>

<h2>Learning and Study</h2>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/learning.html"-->
<a name="Learning"></a>
<h3>Learning</h3>

The process of reading, learning vocabulary, solving problems, and writing
is the only way to achieve real understanding and skills. No one else
can read, think, or write for you. It can be very helpful to watch other
people solve problems and explain ideas in class, in a video, in a study
group, or in a tutoring session, but there is no substitute for study
that you do yourself.

<p>

The time expectation for out-of-class work is two hours outside of class for
every one hour of class meeting time. Plan your study time in your weekly
schedule. 

<p>

The quality of your out-of-class study translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little study time guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality studying guarantees a positive learning
experience. Here is an outline of the work flow for each section in the text(s).

<p>

  <ul>
  <li><b>BEFORE class.</b> Read the text material indicated on the
	  course calendar. Make vocabulary study cards (or study lists)
	  for terminology, facts, and formulas from the new text
	  section. Work and submit to Canvas all of the exercises marked
	  with an asterisk "*"
	  in the <a href="#reading_and_exercises">"Reading and
	  Exercises"</a> list above. Note your questions, problems, and
	  difficulties. In the reading, where, precisely, do you have
	  trouble understanding? With the problems, what, precisely, is
	  obstructing you from completing a solution?
    <li><b>AFTER class.</b>  Review text material from
		previous class meetings. Revise your vocabulary and fact
		note cards; make sure your vocabulary list is complete.
		Solve and check solutions to all of the remaining problems
		in the "Reading and Exercises" list above.
    <li><b>BEFORE each quiz.</b>  Assess your progress and
	proficiency. Have you addressed all the questions and
	difficulties noted previously?  Rehearse vocabulary using the
	cards or lists you have prepared.  Practice solving problems
	using a timer.  Follow up on any questions or gaps that remain.
    <li><b>AFTER each quiz.</b>  Assess (again!) your progress and
		      proficiency. Rework and check solutions to all
		      quiz problems for which you received less than
		      full credit.  Follow up (again!) on any questions
		      or gaps that remain.
  </ul>


<h3>Study Strategies</h3>

<ul>
<li>Plan for two hours of study outside of class for each hour of class.
<li>Keep an organized paper binder or electronic notebook with reading notes, homework solutions, and
  class notes (see the <a href="#Portfolio">Portfolio</a> section
  below). Mark your questions clearly with sticky notes or some 
  other device and follow up every question, either in class
  or in office hours, until you gain understanding.
<li>After reading, summarize the material in your own words.
<li>Use flash cards or lists to learn
  vocabulary. Write each term on one side of a card. Write a definition
  (using complete sentences, not sentence fragments) and an example on
  the back of the card.
<li>To prepare for quizzes and exams, do the following, beginning some
  days to a week in advance.
<ul>
<li>Make an outline of course topics and problem types.
<li>Memorize vocabulary, including examples.
<li>Work and check solutions to problems from previous quizzes, exams,
  and homework.
</ul>
<li>If clock management during exams is an issue, practice working a few
  exam style problems once a week with a timer running.
<li>If test anxiety has a negative effect on your performance, here
  is <a href="http://www.studygs.net/tstprp8.htm">some advice</a>.
    <li>Do not become sleep deprived. Trading sleep for study time is
      counterproductive.
      <li>Eat a healthy diet and exercise every day. Eating poorly and
      lack of physical activity reduce your mental abilities.
</ul>

<h3>Portfolio</h3>

Keep your work organized. Use electronic or hard copy media, whatever
works best for you. Whatever method you use, it should be designed to
facilitate sorting, searching, planning, and tracking. A complete
portfolio includes:
<ul>
  <li>Progress tracking sheet(s) (make a copy of
  the <a href="#reading_and_exercises">Reading and Exercises</a> list that you can use for checking off the work you have completed)
  <li>Vocabulary notecards or study sheets (here
  are  <a href="../../syllabus_common/sample_notecards1.pdf">example notecards</a>)
  <li>Reading and class notes
  <li>Solved exercises
</ul>
Your portfolio is an essential tool for learning; it is also an essential
instrument for diagnosis and improvement. Bring your portfolio to class
meetings and to office hours.
