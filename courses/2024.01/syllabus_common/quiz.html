<h3>Quizzes</h3>  

We will have a quiz at the beginning of class one day each week.
Quiz problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned reading and
exercises. For each quiz, the format and subject matter will be
announced in advance.

  The final exam period may be used for one last quiz. The final exam
  period will also be used for any needed makeup quizzes:
  see the <a href="#make_up">"Makeup Assignments"</a> policy below. Whether and how
  the final exam period will be used will be announced near the end of
  the semester.

  <h4>Quizzes: Grading</h4>

For full credit, quiz solutions must show not just final results, but
also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work and using appropriate
vocabulary that you understand the reasoning involved. Some solutions
(marked by the label "<b>DISCUSSION</b>") must be written in narrative
form, using one or more complete sentences.  Solutions will be graded
not only for mathematical correctness, but for clarity of writing.
Illegible work or a final answer given without supporting work shown
receives no credit.
