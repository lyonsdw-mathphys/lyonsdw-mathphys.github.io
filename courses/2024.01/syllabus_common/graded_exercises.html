<h3>Graded Exercises</h3>

Graded Exercises are those marked with an asterisk "*" in
the  <a href="#reading_and_exercises">"Reading and Exercises"</a> list
above. These exercises are chosen to help understand the material in the reading. You are not expected to
solve all of the Graded Exercises perfectly, but you are expected to
try. Graded Exercises will be graded for preparation and completeness, not
for correctness. For full credit, all solutions must be written in
narrative form, using one or more complete sentences.

<p>

Submit Graded Exercises online on Canvas.  Your work may be typed or
written by hand. Your work must be submitted as a single pdf file,
whether it is handwritten or typed (pdf scanning is a built-in utility
for iphones and android phones).  Work is not accepted late. There are
no makeup assignments.
