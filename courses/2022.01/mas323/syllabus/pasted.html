<h2>Course Content</h2>
<!--@include "description.html"-->
<h3>Course Description</h3>

This course is an introduction to group theory combined with an
introduction to modern geometries. Group theory topics include
properties of groups and homomorphisms and actions of groups on
sets. Geometry topics include the basic theory of MÃ¶bius, hyperbolic,
elliptic, and projective geometries.

<h3>Reading and Problem List</h3>

<pre>
The reading list is Chapters 1, 2, and 3 of the textbook. The problem
list is all the problems in each section of the textbook.
</pre>

<a name="goals_etc"></a>
<h3>Course Goals, Objectives, and Learning Outcomes</h3>

The primary goal of the course is <b>mathematical intellectual
growth</b> through the <b>understanding and mastery of mathematical
concepts</b>. Student learning objectives are strength and fluency
in <b>reading</b>, in <b>analysis and problem solving</b>, and
in <b>clear, concise communication</b>. Achievement of goals and
learning objectives requires desire for learning, willingness to work
hard, time commitment (at least two hours on homework outside of class
for each hour in class), and persistence.

<p>
  
<b>Learning Outcomes Summary</b>. Through the medium of the mathematical concepts of this
course, a student who achieves the course learning objectives will:
<ul>
<li>have increased strength and fluency in reading skills
<li>have increased strength and fluency in analysis and problem solving skills
<li>have increased strength and fluency in clear, concise communication skills
</ul>

<h2>Grades</h2>

<!--@include "graded_work_3XX.html"-->
<h3>Graded Work</h3>

Your cumulative average is determined by graded work in the categories listed
below with the indicated weights. Details and instructions are given in
the sections that follow.

<pre>
  Daily Participation    10%
  Written Assignments    35%
  Exams (non-final)      35%
  Final exam             20%
</pre>



  
<!--@include "seminar_participation.html"-->
<h3>Daily Participation</h3>

Daily participation consists of presenting solutions to problems and
participating in discussion of presentations made by other students and
the instructor. Presentations will be graded for effort and
completeness, but not for correctness. Because the list of problems and
the roster rotation is known in advance, students will usually be able to plan
ahead and coordinate who will present which problem. In the case that
one's pre-prepared problem is already "taken", the presenter will
display a positive spirit and make an honest attempt at improvising a
solution to a new problem. Here is the grading rubric.

<p>

  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Daily presentations</th>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Category</b></th>
    <th> Description</b></th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> Complete</td>
    <td> Presentations are fully prepared in a
      way that shows a good faith effort to thoroughly complete the
      assignment. In case of a last-minute problem change, the presenter
      makes an honest attempt and improvises in a positive spirit.
    </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> Partially complete</td>
    <td> A presentation that should have been thoroughly prepared is not fully complete or shows
    little effort. </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> No credit</td>
    <td> Presentations are not prepared. </td>
    </td>
</tr>

<!--@include "written_work_grading.html"-->
<h3>Writing Assignments</h3>  

Writing assignments must be typed and must use appropriate mathematical
symbols and typesetting conventions. Handwritten solutions will not be
accepted. Your writing assignment will be graded for correctness in the following ways:
for correct use of vocabulary and notation; for correct logical flow in your
argument; and for the correct final conclusion(s). The grading rubric
for each written solution is the same as for the "Exam Grading Rubric"
(below) with the addition of the following in the description of the top
category called "complete and correct".

<blockquote>
  The written solution is typed and uses appropriate mathematical
    symbols and typesetting conventions.
</blockquote>
