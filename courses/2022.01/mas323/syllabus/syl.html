<h2><a name="Grades"></a> Grades</h2>

<!--@include "graded_work_3XX.html"-->
<h3><a name="Graded Work">11</a> Graded Work</h3>

Your cumulative average is determined by graded work in the categories listed
below with the indicated weights. Details and instructions are given in
the sections that follow.

<pre>
  Daily Participation    10%
  Written Assignments    35%
  Exams (non-final)      35%
  Final exam             20%
</pre>



  
<!--@include "seminar_participation.html"-->
<h3><a name="Daily Participation">12</a> Daily Participation</h3>

Daily participation consists of presenting solutions to problems and
participating in discussion of presentations made by other students and
the instructor. Presentations will be graded for effort and
completeness, but not for correctness. Because the list of problems and
the roster rotation is known in advance, students will usually be able to plan
ahead and coordinate who will present which problem. In the case that
one's pre-prepared problem is already "taken", the presenter will
display a positive spirit and make an honest attempt at improvising a
solution to a new problem. Here is the grading rubric.

<p>

  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Daily presentations</th>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Category</b></th>
    <th> Description</b></th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> Complete</td>
    <td> Presentations are fully prepared in a
      way that shows a good faith effort to thoroughly complete the
      assignment. In case of a last-minute problem change, the presenter
      makes an honest attempt and improvises in a positive spirit.
    </td>

<!--@include "written_work_grading.html"-->
<h3><a name="Writing Assignments">13</a> Writing Assignments</h3>

Writing assignments must be typed and must use appropriate mathematical
symbols and typesetting conventions. Handwritten solutions will not be
accepted. Your writing assignment will be graded for correctness in the following ways:
for correct use of vocabulary and notation; for correct logical flow in your
argument; and for the correct final conclusion(s). The grading rubric
for each written solution is the same as for the "Exam Grading Rubric"
(below) with the addition of the following in the description of the top
category called "complete and correct".

<blockquote>
  The written solution is typed and uses appropriate mathematical
    symbols and typesetting conventions.
</blockquote>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/exam_grading_1XX.html"-->
<h3><a name="Exams">14</a> Exams</h3>

Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. In keeping with College
policy, the final exam can only be taken at the officially scheduled
time during final exams week.

<p>



  
For full credit, quiz and exam solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work and using
appropriate vocabulary that you understand the reasoning involved. Some
solutions must be written in narrative form, using one or more complete
sentences.  Solutions will be graded not only for mathematical
correctness, but for clarity of writing.  Illegible work or a final
answer given without supporting work shown receives no credit.

<p>

No music listening devices or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during quizzes or exams. If you need to leave the
classroom during an exam, you must leave your cell phone at the
instructor's desk in the front of the room.

<p>

<b>Exam replacement policy:</b> In the event that it becomes infeasible
to carry out one or more of the face-to-face exams, including the final
exam (for example, due to a pandemic or extreme weather or some other
reason), the instructor may replace one or more of those exams by
take-home assignments, possibly with different weights than the exams
that are being replaced.

<p>
  
Here is the rubric for each exam problem solution. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.

    shows appropriate work, and uses appropriate
      vocabulary. Calculations and logical reasoning are correct.
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>Substantive progress</td>
    <td> The solution shows understanding of facts, methods, and issues
      involved, but does not meet the description of "complete and
      correct".
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>Some progress</td>
    <td> The response shows plausible
    evidence that some aspect of the problem is grasped, but does not
    meet the description of "substantive progress".
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>No progress</td>
    <td> The response is blank, illegible, or shows
    no plausible evidence that some key aspect of the solution is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/make_up.html"-->
<h3><a name="Makeup Assignments, Makeup Exams, and Extra Credit">15</a> Makeup Assignments, Makeup Exams, and Extra Credit</h3>

There are no makeup assignments, makeup exams, or extra credit
assignments. 
<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/letter_grades.html"-->
<h3><a name="Letter Grades">16</a> Letter Grades</h3>

<h4>Meaning of letter grades</h4>

According to the College Catalog, letter grades have the following
meanings.

<pre>
   Letter Grade     Meaning
   ------------     ------
        A           excellent
        B           good
        C           satisfactory
        D           requirements and standards met at a minimum level
        F           course requirements not met
</pre>

Standards for "excellent" and "good" (letter grades A and B) are high.
In this course, your grade reflects your mastery of the material.  A good
grade is not guaranteed by class attendance and performing the motions of
homework; to earn an A or a B, you must demonstrate understanding that
transcends mere rote familiarity.

<h4>Determination of letter grade</h4>

At the end of the semester, your final cumulative average is used to
assign a letter grade.  The scale used to convert cumulative averages to
letter grades is based on the "standard 10 point scale" (A-,A,A+ for
90 to 100 percent range, B-,B,B+ for percentages in the 80's, C-,C,C+
for the 70's, etc.), but the scale may be adjusted, at the discretion of
the instructor, so that the meanings of the letter grades fit the
descriptions given in the previous section. Pluses and minuses are used
to distinguish between the low, middle and high achievers within each
letter grade category.

<p>
<i>Note on mid-term grades:</i> Pluses and minuses are not used for
midterm grades.



<h2><a name="Policies"></a> Policies</h2>

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/attendance.html"-->
<h3><a name="Attendance">17</a> Attendance</h3>

Class attendance is expected, but it is understood that sometimes there
are reasonable circumstances for absence. For most students, there is no
grade for attendance or participation (see the exception for "chronic
absenteeism" below), but it is expected that each student will exercise
good judgment for choosing to miss a class.

<p>

Except for exam days, excuses for absences are not required. Absence
from an exam may be excused, at the discretion of the instructor, for
certain events planned in advance or for emergency or illness. Here is
the procedure to follow if you wish to have an exam absence excused.
<ul>
<li>Send the instructor email notice of your exam absence as far as
  possible in advance of the missed exam, with a complete
  explanation for the purpose of your conflicting event.
    <li>In the case of illness or emergency where advance notice
      is not possible, send an email message as soon as it is practically possible. Collect
      documentation (doctor's notes, etc) to present to the instructor
      when you return to class. Except for extreme circumstances, your
      email notice is due by 5pm on the
      day of the missed exam.
</ul>

<p>

Absence does not change the due date for any graded work. 

<p>

  <b>Policy for chronic absenteeism:</b> Chronic unexcused absence has a
  negative impact on classroom learning. The instructor may elect to
  impose a grade deduction for each unexcused absence beyond the
  third. Communication will be made by email when this policy is in
  effect.

<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/class_engagement.html"-->
<h3><a name="Class Engagement">18</a> Class Engagement</h3>
  
The purpose of class meetings is to pursue understanding and mastery of
the course material. This requires mental presence, engagement with the
subject, and participation. Class meetings presume respect, politeness,
and kindness among all those in attendance. In consideration for the
learning environment, please observe the following in the classroom.

<ul>
  <li>Online attendees must have video on.
<li>No food during class (face-to-face or online attendance).
<li>Use electronic devices only for engaging with the course
  material. For example, note-taking, calculating, and looking up facts
  related to the class discussion are positive activities; text
  messaging, social media browsing, and web surfing are rude behaviors
  that distract everyone from focusing.
  <li>Except for emergencies, please do not leave the class meeting once class
  begins. If you need to leave before the end of class, please inform
  the instructor before class begins.
</ul>


<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/collaboration.html"-->
<h3><a name="Collaboration versus Plagiarism">19</a> Collaboration versus Plagiarism</h3>

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and ask questions of the
instructor or consult any source for homework and out-of-class writing
exercises.  You must work hard to avoid plagiarism, which is presenting someone
else's ideas or work as your own.  <b>The work you submit must be your own.</b> Your
writing must be your own voice and your own understanding.  You must use proper
academic citation for any material created by others.  Plagiarism is a serious
academic offense; penalties range from failing the course to expulsion from the
college.
<!--@include "../../syllabus_common/honor_policy.html"-->
<h3><a name="Honor Policy">20</a> Honor Policy</h3>

It is expected that each student in this class will act with honesty and 
academic integrity.  Instances of academic dishonesty will be pursued as
described in the College Catalog and Student Handbook.

<h2><a name="Learning and Study"></a> Learning and Study</h2>

<!--@include "../../study/study_strategies.html"-->
<h3><a name="Learning">21</a> Learning</h3>

Learning through study outside of class is the most important part of the course.
The process of reading, thinking, solving problems, and writing
is the only way to achieve real understanding and skills. No one else
can read, think, or write for you. It can be very helpful to watch other
people solve problems and explain ideas in class, in a video, in a study
group, or in a tutoring session, but that is no substitute for study
that you do yourself.

<p>

The time expectation for out-of-class study is two hours outside of class for
every hour of class meeting time. Plan your study time in your weekly
schedule. 

<p>

The quality of your out-of-class study translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little time spent studying guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality studying guarantees a positive learning
experience. Here is an outline of the studying process.

<p>

  <ul>
  <li><b>BEFORE each class meeting</b>
  <ul>
	<li><b>Read</b> the text section(s) indicated on
	  the course calendar.
	  <li><b>Write</b> vocabulary and facts from the new text
	    section. Make vocabulary study cards.
	    <li><b>Solve</b> at least a few of the low numbered problems
	      from the new text section.
	      <li><b>Note</b> your questions, problems, and
	      difficulties. In the reading, where, precisely, do you
	      have trouble understanding? With the problems, what,
		precisely, is obstructing you from completing a
		solution?
  </ul>
    <li><b>AFTER each class meeting</b>
  <ul>
		<li><b>Reread</b> text sections listed for previous
		  class meetings.
		  <li><b>Solve more</b> problems. Complete the list of
		  homework problems from text sections for previous
		    class days. Prepare complete written solutions,
		  using complete sentences.
		    <li><b>Revise</b> and update your vocabulary and
		    fact note cards after a second round with
		      each section of text.
  </ul>
    <li><b>EVERY WEEK</b>
  <ul>		      
		      <li><b>Assess</b> your progress and mastery. Have
		      you addressed all the questions and difficulties
			noted previously?
			<li><b>Follow up</b> on any questions or gaps
			that remain.
  </ul>
  </ul>


<h3><a name="Study Strategies">22</a> Study Strategies</h3>

<ul>
<li>Plan for two hours of study outside of class for each hour of class.
<li>Keep an organized paper binder or electronic notebook with reading notes, homework solutions, and
  class notes. Mark your questions clearly with sticky notes or some
  other device and follow up every question, either in class
  or in office hours, until you gain understanding.
<li>After reading, summarize the material in your own words.
<li>Use flash cards or lists to learn
  vocabulary. Write each term on one side of a card. Write a definition
  (using complete sentences, not sentence fragments) and an example on
  the back of the card.
<li>To prepare for quizzes and exams, do the following, beginning some
  days to a week in advance.
<ul>
<li>Make an outline of course topics and problem types.
<li>Memorize vocabulary, including examples.
<li>Work and check solutions to problems from previous quizzes, exams,
  and homework.
</ul>
<li>If clock management during exams is an issue, practice working a few
  exam style problems once a week with a timer running.
<li>If test anxiety has a negative effect on your performance, here
  is <a href="http://www.studygs.net/tstprp8.htm">some advice</a>.
    <li>Do not become sleep deprived. Trading sleep for study time is
      counterproductive.
      <li>Eat a healthy diet and exercise every day. Eating poorly and
      lack of physical activity reduce your mental abilities.
</ul>
