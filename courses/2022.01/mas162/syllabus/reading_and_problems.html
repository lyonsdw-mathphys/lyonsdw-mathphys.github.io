Course reading assignments are the text sections listed above. The
amount of problem solving practice needed to achieve mastery varies by
individual. Here are two extremes.

<ul>
<li><b>Maximum practice needed:</b> work every "Example", work all of the "Activity"
problems, and work all of the "Exercises" in each section
<li><b>Minimum practice needed:</b> work approximately every other
  problem in the "Exercises" at the end of each section 
</ul>
