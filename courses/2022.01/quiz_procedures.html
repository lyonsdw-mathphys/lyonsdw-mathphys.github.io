<h3>Instructions</h3>

    participants) with video on and with sound off during the quiz.
  <li>
    Write your solutions on your own sheet(s) of paper.

    Copy the answer boxes on the problem sheet to your answer sheet and
    fill in your answers. You do not need to copy the statements of the
    problems onto your answer sheet.
  <li>
    Show supporting work for each problem that demonstrates how you found your answers.
  <li>
    Final answers with no supporting work shown receive no credit!
  <li>
    For problems labeled <b>“DISCUSSION”</b>, write your solution using
    one or more complete sentences. Express the main idea of your
    solution and use appropriate vocabulary from the text to demonstrate
    your understanding.
  <li>
    When you are finished writing your solutions, use your phone to scan
    your answer sheet(s) to a single pdf file and then upload to Canvas.
  <li>
    Submit only your answer sheet. Your copy of the problem sheet is yours to keep.
</ul>

<h3>Rules</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    During the quiz, do not wear a brimmed hat or a hood or anything
    that covers your eyes; you may wear a brimless ski hat or you may
    keep wearing a ball cap if you turn the brim to the back.
  <li>
    Place your phone in plain view on your desk (for in-class,
    face-to-face students) or somewhere in plain view in your Zoom panel
    (for online students) during the quiz. Do not pick up your phone
    until you are scanning and submitting your quiz.
  <li>
    If you finish and submit before the time limit, you may leave the
    classroom or the Zoom view for a short break. Leave your phone in
    plain view on your desk or in your Zoom panel while you are away.

    By submitting your work, you attest to the following statement.

    exam. This work is my own."</ul>
