<h3>Quizzes</h3>  

We will have a quiz with two or three problems at the beginning of class
one day each week.  Quiz problems are based on, but not limited to, the
assigned reading and exercises. The problems on any given quiz come from
material that is listed on the Course Schedule at least one week prior
to the quiz date.

<p>

Quiz format, subject matter, and rules will be announced in
advance. Detailed quiz instructions, rules, and procedures are listed
below. We will use the scheduled final exam time slot for one last quiz.

</ul>

<h4>Quizzes: rules</h4>

    face-to-face students) or somewhere in plain view in your Zoom panel

    If you finish and submit before the time limit, you may leave the
    classroom or the Zoom view for a short break. Leave your phone in
    plain view on your desk or in your Zoom panel while you are away.

    exam. This work is my own."</ul>
</ul>

<p>

  <h4>Quizzes: grading</h4>

For full credit, quiz solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work and using
appropriate vocabulary that you understand the reasoning involved. Some
solutions must be written in narrative form, using one or more complete
sentences.  Solutions will be graded not only for mathematical
correctness, but for clarity of writing.  Illegible work or a final
answer given without supporting work shown receives no credit.

Here is the rubric for each quiz problem solution. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.
