<h3>Quizzes</h3>  

We will have a quiz with two or three problems at the beginning of class
one day each week.  Quiz problems are based on, but not limited to, the
assigned reading and exercises. The problems on any given quiz come from
material that is listed on the Course Schedule at least one week prior
to the quiz date.

<p>

Quiz format, subject matter, and rules will be announced in
advance. Detailed quiz instructions are
posted <a href="../../quiz_procedures.html">here</a>. We will use the
scheduled final exam time slot for one last quiz.

<p>

For full credit, quiz solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work and using
appropriate vocabulary that you understand the reasoning involved. Some
solutions must be written in narrative form, using one or more complete
sentences.  Solutions will be graded not only for mathematical
correctness, but for clarity of writing.  Illegible work or a final
answer given without supporting work shown receives no credit.

<p>

Here is the rubric for each quiz problem solution. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.

    <tr>
    <td>Complete and correct</td>

    <tr>
    <td>Substantive progress</td>
    <td> The solution shows understanding of facts, methods, and issues
      involved, but does not meet the description of "complete and
      correct".
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>Some progress</td>
    <td> The response shows plausible
    evidence that some aspect of the problem is grasped, but does not
    meet the description of "substantive progress".
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>No progress</td>
    <td> The response is blank, illegible, or shows
    no plausible evidence that some key aspect of the solution is grasped.</td>
