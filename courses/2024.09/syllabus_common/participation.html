<h3>Class Participation</h3>

There are two ways that class participation counts towards your
grade. One is attendance (see the <a href="#attendance">"Attendance"
  section</a>) and the other is in-class presentations of solutions to problems.
The rotation schedule for presentations and which problems you will
present will be announced in advance. Presentations will be graded for effort and
completeness, but not for correctness. Here is the presentation grading rubric.

    <th> Description</b></th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> Complete</td>
    <td> A presentation is fully prepared in a
      way that shows a good faith effort to thoroughly complete the
      assignment. 
    </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> Partially complete</td>
    <td> A presentation that should have been thoroughly prepared is not fully complete or shows
    little effort. </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> No credit</td>
    <td> A problem solution is not prepared or is not presented. </td>
    </td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
  Your class participation grade is based on the assumption that
  students will attend class and will make presentations when it is
  their turn. Just for showing up and for making complete presentations,
  you earn a participation grade of 100% in the form of 5 out of 5
  points for each half semester. Each unexcused absence, and each presentation rubric score
  less than "complete", subtracts 1 point from the total 5 points
  possible for that half semester.
