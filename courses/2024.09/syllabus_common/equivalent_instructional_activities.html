<h3>Equivalent Instructional Activities</h3>

<p>

In the event of a canceled class, work on your portfolio (see the
<a href="#Portfolio">Portfolio</a> Section). Making your portfolio more complete, more
  thorough, and more clear is the best possible thing you can do to
  replace missed class meeting time. This extra portfolio work will count in the category "Blogs and
  Journals" in the "Equivalent Instructional Activities" document on the
<a href="https://lvc4.sharepoint.com/sites/FacultyandStaff/SitePages/Equivalent-Instructional-Activities.aspx">
  web pages </a> of the LVC Registrar.
