<h3>Writing Assignments</h3>  

Writing assignments must be typed and must use appropriate mathematical
symbols and typesetting conventions. Handwritten solutions will not be
accepted. Your writing assignment will be graded for correctness in the
following ways: for correct use of vocabulary and notation; for correct
logical flow in your argument; and for the correct final
conclusion(s).

<p>
<b>Audience and sources.</b> Write for a reader who is a fellow student
in this class. You may assume that the reader is familiar with all of
the definitions and facts stated in the course text(s), so you do not
have to repeat them in your writing. If you use any new definitions that
do not come from the course text(s), then you need to state them in your
writing. If you cite facts that are not stated in the course text(s),
then you need to state them and prove them yourself in your
writing. Otherwise, your proof can
only use facts that are established in the course text(s).

<p>
  <b>Acknowledgments.</b> If you consult with anyone besides the
  instructor, or if you use any source besides the course textbook in
  the process of developing your solution or helping with your writing,
  it is proper academic form to acknowledge these people and sources at the end of your
  writing assignment.
  
<p>

The grading rubric for each written solution is the same
as for the <a href="#quizexam_grading_rubric">"Quiz/Exam Grading
Rubric"</a>, with the addition of the following in the description for
all four rows except "No Progress".

<blockquote>
  The written solution is typed and uses appropriate mathematical
    symbols and typesetting conventions.
