<h2>Summer 2024 Research in Quantum Information Science</h2>

The LVC Mathematical Physics Research Group mentors undergraduate
mathematics, computer science and physics majors in intensive summer
research projects in <b><i>quantum information science (QIS)</i></b>.
QIS is an interdisciplinary field that studies the manipulation of
quantum physical systems to execute computation and communication tasks
in ways that promise to significantly outperform today's most
powerful computers.  The LVC group studies quantum resources
that give quantum protocols their enhanced speed and power as well as
other topics in QIS.

<p>

  <!--
Our nine-week summer session begins with two weeks of background work to
introduce basic vocabulary, tools, and problems of QIS.  The next six
weeks are devoted to individual research projects that often involve
computer experiments.  The final week consists of writing up results.
All students present their work in poster sessions or short talks at
local or national conferences during the following academic year. Some
of our students have co-authored papers in research journals.  Students
receive summer stipend pay, summer room and board (lunch only for
commuters), and travel expenses to conferences. <i>[Note: travel funding
for academic year 2015-16 depends on grant decisions that will not be
available until summer 2015. Travel may therefore be limited to local
conferences this year.]  </i>

Minimum requirements are an introductory course in linear algebra (MAS
222, usually taken in the fall of the 2nd year), a love of creative
problem solving, and a willingness to work hard. Additional study in
mathematics, physics, or computer science is desirable, but not required.

<p>

[<i>Note: The research program schedule, duration, stipend, and housing
    and meals arrangements will be
announced at the time of position offers, noted below.</i>]
