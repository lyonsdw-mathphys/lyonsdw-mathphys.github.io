<h2>LVC Mathematical Physics Research Group Seminar, Past Semesters</h2>

<h3>Fall 2009</h3>

Ongoing research in stabilizer subgroups and entanglement types.

<h3>Spring 2009</h3>

Series of background survey articles and some linear algebra material in
preperation for summer research.


<h3>Fall 2008</h3>
Series of classical coding topics from Loepp and
Wootters' <i>Protecting Information</i>.  

<h3>Spring 2008</h3>

The seminar takes a hiatus this semester while Dr. Lyons is away on
sabbatical leave.

<h3>Fall 2007</h3>

The Fall 2007 seminar will be working through Nielsen and Chuang's
text.  The meeting time is Wednesdays at 2pm.

<h3>Spring 2007</h3>

The spring 2007 seminar is a continuation of our fall 2006 joint reading
group for faculty and students in mathematics, physics and computer
science on the topic of classical and quantum computational theory.  We
will read and work through <i>Classical and Quantum Computation</i> by
Kitaev, Shen and Vyalyi.  Meeting time is Wednesdays at 4pm in Lynch
184.

<p>

Beginning March 2007, we are working through parts of Loepp and
Wootters' <i>Protecting Information</i>.

Our final meeting for spring 2007 will be Wednesday 4/25.  Think about
topics and sources for next fall's seminar.

<h3>Fall 2006</h3>

The fall 2006 seminar will be a joint reading group for faculty and
students in mathematics, physics and computer science on the topic of
classical and quantum computational theory.  We will read and work
