<p>The "law of averages" is an intuitive statement, confirmed by the SE formulas <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/sesumformula.html" title="Equation 4.2">(4.2)</a>, that the sample percentage of 1's becomes a more and more accurate approximation of the percentage of 1's in a box as the number of draws increases. In statistics terms, "more accurate" means a smaller SE. [The summary at the end of Chapter 16 of our text is stated for the special case of a fair coin box, that is, a box containing half 0's and half 1's. Despite this restriction in the exposition, the authors expect the student to apply the law of averages for arbitrary 0-1 boxes. It should be noted that no SE formulas appear in the text before or in Chapter 16. The authors use the term "absolute error" to refer to the SE for the sum of draws, and use the term "relative error" to mean the fraction SE(sum)/(number of draws). In these terms, the law of averages says that absolute error increases as the number of draws increases, and relative error decreases as the number of draws increases. The authors imply that the law of averages is intuitively clear, whether you are aware of SE formulas or not.]</p>
