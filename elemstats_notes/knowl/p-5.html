<div class="para">The text uses the term "football-shaped" or "shaped like a football" very loosely throughout Ch 8â€”12 to describe a scatter diagram that has linear association. Worse, the term "football-shaped" is sometimes used to imply homoscedasticity. Even worse, "football-shaped" seems to sometimes imply that both variables involved in the scatter diagram are normally distributed (see the box on p.197). Because of this vagueness and ambiguity, we will instead use the terms "shows linear association", "homoscedastic", and "normally distributed" for these various attributes that may or may not apply to 2-variable data. In particular, in the box on p.197, and also in item 7 of the Ch 11 summary on p.201, replace the first sentence with "Suppose that a scatter diagram shows linear association, is homoscedastic, and that both variables are distributed normally."</div>
