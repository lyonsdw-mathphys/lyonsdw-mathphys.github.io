<p>A <dfn class="terminology">histogram</dfn> for a list of numbers <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is a drawing with a collection of rectangles. The base of each rectangle is an interval, called a <dfn class="terminology">class interval</dfn>, of a horizontal axis whose units are the same as <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> (that is, if the numbers in <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> are dollars, or years, then the units of the horizontal axis are dollars or years, etc). The area of a rectangle whose base is the class interval from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is the fraction of the numbers in the list <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> that lie between <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> For example, if <span class="process-math">\(40\%\)</span> of the numbers in the list <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> are in the range 10 to 30, then a rectangle in a histogram for <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> whose base is the class interval from 10 to 30 has area <span class="process-math">\(0.4 = 40\%\text{,}\)</span> and therefore has a height of <span class="process-math">\(.4/(30-10) = .02 = 2\)</span> percent per <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> unit. The vertical axis in a histogram has units called <dfn class="terminology">density</dfn> units. Rectangles in a histogram must be non-overlapping, and the total area of all the rectangles must be <span class="process-math">\(100\%\text{.}\)</span> [See Example 1 on p.40 of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/freedman_statistics.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 1: Statistics, 4th edition">[1]</a> for an illustration.]</p>
