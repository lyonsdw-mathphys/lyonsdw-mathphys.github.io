<div class="para">Imagine walking along the number line from a starting point <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to a final point <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> The difference <span class="process-math">\(B-A\)</span> is called the <dfn class="terminology">displacement</dfn> from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> or the <dfn class="terminology">deviation</dfn> of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> In words, the deviation of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is how far <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> on the number line, with the directional information indicated by a plus or minus sign. If <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is less than <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> (this is the same as <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> being to the left of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> in the standard orientation of the number line), then the deviation of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is negative. Likewise, if <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is greater than <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> (or <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is to the right of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> in the standard orientation of the number line), then the deviation of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is positive. Finally, if <span class="process-math">\(B=A\text{,}\)</span> then the deviation of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is zero.</div>
