Doo Wop song for Math and Physics

Who put the "Ham" in the Hamiltonian?
Who put the "Schroe" in the Schroedinger equation?
Who put the "Reide" in the Reidemeister moves?
Who put the "stabe" in the stabilizer subgroup?

Who's that ma-a-an?
I'd like to shake his ha-and
He made my physics fall in love with ma-ath.
