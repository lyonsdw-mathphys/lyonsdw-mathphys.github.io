Since spring 2008, David Lyons (Mathematical Sciences) and Scott Walck
(Physics) have jointly published 4 papers in physics research journals
in the area of quantum information science (QIS).  The two researchers have
also delivered 8 seminar presentations to regional, national and
international colloquia and research groups.  (See their
<a href="http://quantum.lvc.edu/mathphys/pubs2.html">web site</a> for
bibliographic details.)

<p>

QIS seeks to understand the computational and communication power of
physical systems that operate on a scale so small that they are governed
by the weird rules of quantum mechanics.  The applied side of this
science works to solve engineering problems to construct new devices
called quantum computers that will carry out fantastic and powerful new
kinds of computation.  Lyons and Walck work on the theoretical side of
QIS, where they study the phenomenon of quantum entanglement that plays
a key role, yet is poorly understood. Lyons and Walck have pursued a
program that achieves a partial classification of entanglement types
using mathematical tools.

<p>

Work in the last 18 months continues Lyons' and Walck's program of studying the
phenomenon of quantum entanglement as it pertains to applications in
quantum computing and communications.  Loosely speaking, they seek to
identify quantum states that will be especially useful for applications
of quantum information theory.  They also study the relation between
information contained in quantum states and information contained in
subsystems.  Both of these lines of investigation are of active interest
to researchers in mathematics, physics, computer science, and chemistry.

<p>

In September 2009, Lyons and Walck were awarded a National
Science Foundation (NSF) grant, renewable for 3 years, that continues
the work funded by their previous NSF grant.  Their current project is a
series of investigations that follows naturally from previous work in
entanglement classification.

Lyons and Walck mentor and collaborate with student research assistants.
Recent student researchers have been Stephanie Blanda '09, Curt Cenci
'11, Laura Snyder '11, and Adam Hansell '11.
