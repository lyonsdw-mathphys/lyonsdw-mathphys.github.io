Congratulations to Curt Cenci '11, who won one of 32 cash prize awards
out of a national competitive field of 233 entries at the Mathematical
Association of America Undergraduate Poster Session in San Francisco,
January 2010.  The $100 prize was earned by Curt's poster, titled
"Quantum Information and 1-Dimensional Stabilizers in Multiparty
States," which presented Curt's research conducted during summer 2009
under the direction of faculty advisors David Lyons (Mathematics) and
Scott Walck (Phyics).  The poster session was part of the national Joint
Meetings of the Mathematical Association of America and the American
Mathematical Society.  For more information on the student-faculty
