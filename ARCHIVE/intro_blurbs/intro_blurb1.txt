			  Quantum Information 
		       A Very Basic Introduction
		       =========================

What is the most basic unit of information?  What does it mean to
communicate information?  The answer is illustrated in Longfellow's poem
"The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere," in which Revere's friend is
instructed to shine signal lanterns from the tower of Boston's North Church

 "One if by land, and two if by sea"

to alert the patriot defense forces of the direction of the imperial
enemy's attack.

What Revere's friend is sending is a {\em bit}---the most basic unit of
information.  The bit represents one of two possibilites that can be yes
or no, on or off, 0 or 1, or in the case of this poem, land or sea.



The simplest communication scenario has a
sender, who we call Alice, and a receiver, who we call Bob.  The
simplest message Alice can send to Bob is a  "yes"
or "no".  This yes/no information is the most basic unit of i

What does it mean to communicate?  The most basic
unit of information is the {\em bit}

In our everyday familiar world, the basic unit of information is the
{\em bit}.  A bit has two possible states that we call 1 and 0, on and
off, yes and no.  Your computer stores letters as strings of bits, words
as longer strings of bits, and documents, song recordings and videos as
even longer strings of bits.

In the quantum world, more is possible.  Where a bit has only two
possible states, a {\em quantum bit} can be 
any point on the surface of a ball.
