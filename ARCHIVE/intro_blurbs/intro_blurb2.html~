<h3>A Very Basic Introduction to Quantum Information</h3>

What is the most basic unit of information?  The answer is illustrated
in Longfellow's poem
<a href="http://www.nationalcenter.org/PaulRevere'sRide.html">"The
Midnight Ride of Paul Revere"</a>,  in which Revere's friend is
instructed to shine signal lanterns from the tower of Boston's North Church

<pre>

   "One if by land, and two if by sea"

</pre>

to alert the rebel defense forces of the direction of impending attack
by the imperial enemy.

<p>

What Revere's friend is sending is a <i>bit</i>---the most basic unit of
information.  The bit in this poem represents a choice between the two
possibilities "land" and "sea".  More generally, a bit can represent any
pair of choices: yes or no; on or off; buy or sell; or 0 or 1.

<p>

In the quantum world, the bit is replaced by the <i>quantum bit</i> as
the basic unit of information.  Where the bit must choose between 0 and
1, the quantum bit has an infinite number of in-between states called
<i>superpositions</i> of 0 and 1.  To explain by analogy with a coin, a
bit must be either "heads" or "tails", but a quantum bit can be a little
bit of both <i>at the same time</i>.  <a href
="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schrodinger">Erwin Schr√∂dinger</a>, one
of the early developers of quantum theory, expressed superposition in a
famously stark form with an <a href
="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodingers_cat">experiment</a> in which
his cat is in a state in-between "alive" and "dead".

<p>

Quantum information gets more interesting when more than one quantum bit
is involved.  It is a most remarkable fact that two quantum bits can
exist in <i>entangled</i> states that contain <i>more</i> information
than is possible with two unentangled quantum states.  By contrast, two
bits can only be in one of four possible states: 00, 01, 10 or 11. A
two-bit state is completely specified by the one-bit states of its
single-bit subsystems.  An entangled state of a two-quantum-bit system, 
on the other hand, cannot be fully described by the states of its
single-quantum-bit subsystems.

<p>

Quantum information science took a huge leap in 1994 when <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Shor">Peter Shor</a> discovered
that entangled states can be processed to solve problems that have no
known solution using ordinary bits and computers.  Using Shor's
discovery, quantum computers will be able to crack today's state-of-the
art data encryption.  For example, when you send your credit card
number to a retailer over the internet today, you can be very certain
that your data is secure; once quantum computers have been built, the
code protecting your credit card number can be instantly broken.  Shor's
insight woke up the scientific world to the possibilities and power of
quantum computation.

<p>

Applications of quantum information theory include: computation, such as
Shor's algorithm; communication protocols, such as data encryption that
cannot be broken without violating the laws of physics; and
nanotechnology, such as ultrafine quantum measurement.  These
applications and more motivate a thriving international research community
that involves physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists, and
engineers.
