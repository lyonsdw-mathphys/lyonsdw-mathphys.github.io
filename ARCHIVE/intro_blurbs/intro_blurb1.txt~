			  Quantum Information
		       A Very Basic Introduction
		       =========================

In our everyday familiar world, the basic unit of information is the
{\em bit}.  A bit has two possible states that we call 1 and 0, on and
off, yes and no.  Your computer stores letters as strings of bits, words
as longer strings of bits, and documents, song recordings and videos as
even longer strings of bits.

In the quantum world, more is possible.  Where a bit has only two
possible states, a {\em quantum bit} can be 
any point on the surface of a ball.
