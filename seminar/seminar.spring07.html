<h2>LVC Mathematical Physics Research Group Seminar</h2>


<h3>Spring 2007</h3>

The spring 2007 seminar is a continuation of our fall 2006 joint reading
group for faculty and students in mathematics, physics and computer
science on the topic of classical and quantum computational theory.  We
will read and work through "Classical and Quantum Computation" by
Kitaev, Shen and Vyalyi.  Meeting time is Wednesdays at 4pm in Lynch
184.

<p>

Beginning March 2007, we are working through parts of Loepp and
Wootters' "Protecting Information."  

<p>

Our final meeting for spring 2007 will be Wednesday 4/25.  Think about
topics and sources for next fall's seminar.
