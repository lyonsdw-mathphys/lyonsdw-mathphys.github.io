<h2>Summer Research in Quantum Information Science</h2>

The most effective way to prepare for a career in mathematical,
computer, and physical science is a summer experience in real scientific
research---making conjectures, testing examples, achieving and presenting
results.  In addition to the joy of creative scientific inquiry and the
exhilaration of discovery, there is a concrete practical benefit:
research and presentation is the most powerful activity you can
do to build your resume and strengthen your graduate school
applications.

<p>

The LVC Mathematical Physics Research Group mentors students, usually
mathematics, computer science and physics majors in
the summer after the 2nd or 3rd year, in research projects
in <b><i>quantum information science (QIS)</i></b>.  QIS is an interdisciplinary
field that studies the manipulation of quantum physical systems to
execute computation and communication tasks in ways that significantly
outperform today's most powerful computers.  The LVC group
studies <i>quantum entanglement</i> that gives quantum protocols their
enhanced speed and power as well as other topics in QIS.

<p>

The LVC Mathematical Physics Research Group conducts nine-week intensive
summer sessions with students in mathematical and physical sciences.
The first two weeks introduce basic vocabulary, problems and tools of
QIS.  The next six weeks are devoted to individual research projects
that often involve computer experiments.  The final week consists of
writing up results.  All students present their work in poster sessions
or short talks at local or national conferences during the following
academic year. Some of our students have coauthored papers in research
journals.  Students receive summer stipend pay, summer room and board
(lunch only for commuters), and travel expenses to conferences.

<p>

Minimum requirements are an introductory course in linear algebra (MAS
222, usually taken in the spring of the 2nd year), a love of creative
problem solving, and a willingness to work hard.  Students are not
expected to have already studied "quantum" anything.  

<p>

If a summer job devoted to learning and research sounds
appealing, talk to Dr. Lyons or Dr. Walck.
