<h2>Summer Research in Quantum Information Science</h2>

The most effective way to prepare for a career in mathematical,
computer, and physical science is a summer experience in real scientific
research: making conjectures, testing examples, achieving and presenting
results.  There is no way to describe the joy of creative scientific
inquiry and the exhilaration of discovery, but there is a concrete way
to express the practical benefit: research and presentation is simply
the most powerful activity you can do to build your resume and
strengthen your graduate school applications.

<p>

<b><i>Quantum information science</i></b> is an interdisciplinary field that
studies the manipulation of quantum physical systems to execute
computation and communication tasks in ways that significantly
outperform today's most powerful computers.

<p>

The LVC Mathematical Physics Research Group conducts nine-week intensive
summer sessions with students in mathematical and physical sciences.
All of our students present their work in poster sessions and short
talks at local and national conferences during the following academic
year, and some of our past students have coauthored papers in research
physics journals.  Students receive summer stipend pay, summer room and
board (lunch only for commuters), and travel expenses to conferences.
